# Slide Plan: 7.1 The Program Development Life Cycle

**Goal:** Build the mental model for how every program is born: Analysis → Design → Coding → Testing (with Maintenance noted). Introduce abstraction, decomposition, and how requirements become a plan.

**Pedagogy:** Story-driven cycle. Each stage is modelled, then practised on one running example (an alarm app). Emphasise plain language first, then the formal terms.

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 7.1 The Program Development Life Cycle
  - Sub-title: Topic 7: Algorithm Design and Problem Solving
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Would you build a bridge with no blueprint?
  - **Visual:** Rushed lego tower collapsing vs a neat set of labelled plans.
  - **Key Idea:** Software needs a cycle. Jumping to code is how projects fail.

## 3. Overview of the Cycle
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** The Four Core Stages (+ Maintenance)
  - **Diagram:** Loop: Analysis → Design → Coding → Testing → (Maintenance).
  - **Note:** We focus on the first four; maintenance is shown to stress the loop never stops.

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Analysis (What problem?)
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Definition & Output):**
  - **Definition:** Understand the problem and write a **Requirements Specification**.
  - **Output:** A clear list of inputs, outputs, rules, constraints, success criteria.
- **Slide 2 (Abstraction):**
  - Strip away noise; keep only what matters.
  - **Example:** A rail map shows stations and links, not every curve of track.
- **Slide 3 (Decomposition):**
  - Break the big problem into smaller parts.
  - **Micro-task:** Decompose “getting dressed”: choose clothes → remove PJs → socks → shirt → trousers → shoes.
- **Slide 4 (Apply to Alarm App):**
  - Inputs: Set time, Snooze, Off.
  - Outputs: Sound, Screen flash.
  - Constraints: 24-hour time, no duplicate alarms.

### 3.2 Vertical Deep Dive: Design (How will it work?)
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Tools):**
  - Structure Diagrams (top-down), Flowcharts, Pseudocode.
  - **Note:** Pseudocode uses 1-based lists (`StudentName[1]`).
- **Slide 2 (Link Back to Requirements):**
  - Each requirement gets a design element (box on a structure diagram / step in flowchart).
- **Slide 3 (Alarm App Design Snapshot):**
  - Mini structure chart: Set Alarm | Check Time Loop | Sound Alarm.
  - Flowchart fragment: `GET Time` → compare to `AlarmTime` → `OUTPUT AlarmSound`.

### 3.3 Vertical Deep Dive: Coding (Build small, test often)
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Principles):**
  - Choose a language; translate pseudocode.
  - Write one module at a time.
  - **Rule:** Variables and arrays start at 1 in IGCSE pseudocode.
- **Slide 2 (Iterative Testing):**
  - Write → Quick test → Fix → Retest.
  - **Alarm Example:** Implement `CheckTime` loop, test with 2 sample times.

### 3.4 Vertical Deep Dive: Testing (Does it meet the spec?)
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (What to Prove):**
  - Meets every requirement.
  - Works with normal, extreme, abnormal data (introduce terms now, detail later).
- **Slide 2 (System Test of Alarm App):**
  - Try valid time (07:00), boundary (00:00, 23:59), invalid (“25:99” → reject).

## 4. Threading the Stages Together
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** One Example, Four Views
  - Show the alarm app through each stage side-by-side (Spec snippet, Structure diagram, Pseudocode fragment, Test case).
  - Emphasise the loop back: failed test → return to Design/Coding.

## 5. Plenary: Order & Meaning
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1:** Order these: Coding, Testing, Analysis, Design.
  - **Answer:** Analysis → Design → Coding → Testing.
- **Slide 2:** Which stage removes unnecessary detail? **Answer:** Abstraction during Analysis.
- **Slide 3:** Which stage produces a structure diagram? **Answer:** Design.
- **Slide 4:** Which stage uses normal/extreme/abnormal data? **Answer:** Testing.
