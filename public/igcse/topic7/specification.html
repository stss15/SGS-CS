                    Before a single line of code is written, a problem must be understood and solved logically.
                    This topic covers the art of <strong>Computational Thinking</strong>: breaking big problems
                    down into small pieces (<span class="keyword" data-def="a method used in the analysis stage of the program development life cycle; a complex problem is broken down into smaller parts, which can then be sub divided into even smaller parts that can be solved more easily">decomposition</span>), designing step-by-step solutions (<span class="keyword" data-def="an ordered set of steps to solve a problem">algorithms</span>), and
                    ensuring those solutions are robust (<span class="keyword" data-def="part of the program development life cycle; systematic checks done on a program to make sure that it works under all conditions">testing</span> and <span class="keyword" data-def="automated checks carried out by a program that data is reasonable before it is accepted into a computer system">validation</span>). This is the foundation of all
                    programming.
