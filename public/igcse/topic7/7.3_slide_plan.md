# Slide Plan: 7.3 Explaining the Purpose of an Algorithm

**Goal:** Read any flowchart or pseudocode snippet and clearly state its inputs, process, outputs, and overall purpose.

**Pedagogy:** Code Detective. Learners annotate, predict, then dry-run with small data. Use tiny, clear examples with 1-based indices to avoid off-by-one errors.

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 7.3 Explaining the Purpose of an Algorithm
  - Sub-title: Topic 7: Algorithm Design and Problem Solving
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Can you tell what a robot will do before it moves?
  - **Visual:** “Alien” text vs a short pseudocode block.
  - **Key Idea:** Exams often give code and ask “What does this do?” You must translate logic into plain English.

## 3. The Analysis Protocol
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** 4 Steps to Decode
  - **Steps:**
    1. Mark the Inputs (variables read) and Outputs (print/return).
    2. Identify the control: Sequence, IF/CASE, or loop type.
    3. Run a tiny test (mentally) and update variables.
    4. Summarise purpose in one sentence (“It outputs the larger of two numbers.”).

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Alarm Check
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Code Snippet):**
  - `REPEAT` → `WAIT 10` → `GET Time` → `UNTIL Time = AlarmTime` → `OUTPUT AlarmSound`.
- **Slide 2 (Annotate & Purpose):**
  - Inputs: `Time`, `AlarmTime`.
  - Process: Polls every 10s until match.
  - Output: `AlarmSound`.
  - Purpose: Sound the alarm when the system time equals the set time.

### 3.2 Vertical Deep Dive: Largest of Two
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Flowchart/Pseudocode):**
  - `INPUT Num1, Num2` → `IF Num1 > Num2 THEN OUTPUT Num1 ELSE OUTPUT Num2 ENDIF`.
- **Slide 2 (Trace with Data):**
  - Test: Num1=7, Num2=18 → prints 18.
  - Purpose: Output the larger of two input numbers.

### 3.3 Vertical Deep Dive: Pattern Spotting
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Counting Pattern):**
  - `Count <- Count + 1` inside a loop → counts items.
- **Slide 2 (Totalling Pattern):**
  - `Total <- Total + Value` inside a loop → sums items.
- **Slide 3 (Validation Pattern):**
  - `REPEAT ... UNTIL Mark >= 0 AND Mark <= 100` → forces valid data.

## 4. Guided Practice (We Do)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Decode These Quickly
  - Three micro snippets (1-based):
    - `FOR i <- 1 TO 5: OUTPUT "Hello" : NEXT i` → Prints “Hello” five times.
    - `IF Choice = 1 THEN OUTPUT "Add" ELSE OUTPUT "Subtract"` → Menu branch.
    - `Total <- 0; FOR i <- 1 TO 3: INPUT Mark[i]; Total <- Total + Mark[i]; NEXT i` → Totals 3 marks.

## 5. Independent Practice (You Do)
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Mystery 1):**
  - Code uses `REPEAT ... UNTIL Found OR Counter > Length`.
  - **Ask:** What is it doing? (Linear search; stops early if found.)
- **Slide 2 (Mystery 2):**
  - Code: `IF Age < 13 THEN OUTPUT "Child" ELSE OUTPUT "Teen/Adult"`.
  - **Ask:** Describe purpose and one suitable test input for each branch.
- **Slide 3 (Mystery 3):**
  - Flowchart with decision `Number < Lowest?` updating `Lowest`.
  - **Ask:** What final outputs represent? (Lowest value in the list.)
