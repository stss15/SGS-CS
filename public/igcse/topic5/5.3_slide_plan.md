# Slide Plan: 5.3 Cyber Security

**Goal:** Identify common cyber security threats (Hacking, Malware, Phishing) and explain how to prevent them (Authentication, Encryption, Firewalls).

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on "Attack vs Defense".

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 5.3 Cyber Security
  - Sub-title: Topic 5: The Internet and its Uses
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Who is trying to steal your data?
  - **Visual:** A hooded hacker vs a locked vault.
  - **Key Idea:** Data is the new oil. It's valuable, so people want to steal it.

## 3. The Threats (Attack)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** The Arsenal
  - **List:** Hacking, Malware, Phishing, Social Engineering.

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Hacking & Brute Force
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Hacking):**
  - Gaining illegal access.
  - **White Hat:** Ethical hackers (hired to test security).
  - **Black Hat:** Malicious hackers.
- **Slide 2 (Brute Force):**
  - Guessing every password combination.
  - "123456" -> "password" -> "qwerty".
  - **Defense:** Strong passwords, lockout after 3 tries.
- **Slide 3 (DDoS):**
  - Distributed Denial of Service.
  - Flooding a server with traffic to crash it.

### 3.2 Vertical Deep Dive: Malware
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Virus vs Worm):**
  - **Virus:** Needs a host file. User must run it.
  - **Worm:** Standalone. Spreads itself across networks automatically.
- **Slide 2 (Trojan Horse):**
  - Disguised as legitimate software (e.g., "Free Game").
  - Opens a backdoor for hackers.
- **Slide 3 (Ransomware):**
  - Encrypts your files.
  - Demands money (Bitcoin) to unlock them.
- **Slide 4 (Spyware & Adware):**
  - **Spyware:** Keyloggers (records typing).
  - **Adware:** Pop-ups and redirects.

### 3.3 Vertical Deep Dive: Social Engineering
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Phishing):**
  - Fake emails (e.g., "Your bank account is locked").
  - Goal: Steal credentials.
  - **Signs:** Bad spelling, urgent tone, generic greeting.
- **Slide 2 (Pharming):**
  - Malicious code redirects you to a fake website *even if you type the right URL*.
  - DNS Poisoning.
- **Slide 3 (The Human Factor):**
  - Exploiting fear, curiosity, or trust.
  - "You won a prize!" or "Urgent Security Alert!".

## 4. The Defenses (Shield)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Protecting Data
  - **List:** Authentication, Biometrics, Encryption, Firewalls.

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Authentication
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Passwords):**
  - Something you **know**.
  - Strong: Mixed case, numbers, symbols.
- **Slide 2 (Biometrics):**
  - Something you **are**.
  - Fingerprint, Retina, Face ID.
  - **Pros:** Unique, can't lose it.
  - **Cons:** Privacy concerns, can't reset it.
- **Slide 3 (2FA):**
  - Two-Factor Authentication.
  - Password + Phone Code.

### 4.2 Vertical Deep Dive: Technical Defenses
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Firewall):**
  - Monitors traffic in/out.
  - Blocks unauthorized access.
- **Slide 2 (Encryption):**
  - Scrambling data so it's unreadable without a key.
  - Does NOT stop interception, but makes the data useless to the thief.
- **Slide 3 (Anti-Malware):**
  - Scans for known virus signatures.
  - Heuristics (looks for suspicious behavior).

## 5. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "A strong password prevents hacking."
  - **Answer:** False. It helps against Brute Force, but not Phishing or Keyloggers.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "Pharming requires the user to click a link."
  - **Answer:** False. That's Phishing. Pharming redirects you automatically (DNS poisoning).
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "Encryption stops data from being stolen."
  - **Answer:** False. It stops it from being *read*. It can still be stolen/deleted.
- **Slide 5 (Q4):** "Biometrics are 100% secure."
  - **Answer:** False. Fingerprints can be lifted, faces can be spoofed (though it's hard).
