## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 5.2 Digital Currency
  - Sub-title: Topic 5: The Internet and its Uses
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Is the money in your bank account real?
  - **Visual:** A pile of gold vs a number on a screen.
  - **Key Idea:** Most money today is just data. It has no physical form (Fiat Currency).

## 3. Digital Currency vs Cryptocurrency
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Who controls the ledger?
  - **Digital Currency:** Centralized. Controlled by Banks/Governments. (e.g., Apple Pay, PayPal).
  - **Cryptocurrency:** Decentralized. Controlled by the Community/Algorithm. (e.g., Bitcoin).

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: The Difference
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Centralized):**
  - Bank X sends to Bank Y.
  - **Pros:** Regulated, stable.
  - **Cons:** Not anonymous, relies on trust in the bank.
- **Slide 2 (Decentralized):**
  - Peer-to-Peer (Wallet to Wallet).
  - **Pros:** Anonymous, secure, no middleman.
  - **Cons:** Volatile, no help if you lose your key.

## 4. Blockchain (The Engine)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** What is Blockchain?
  - **Definition:** A decentralized, distributed digital ledger.
  - **Key Feature:** Once data is added, it cannot be changed (Immutable).

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: How it Works
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (The Block):**
  - Contains: Data (Transaction), Timestamp, Hash, Previous Hash.
  - **Hash:** A unique digital fingerprint (SHA-256).
- **Slide 2 (The Chain):**
  - Block 1 (Genesis) -> Block 2 -> Block 3.
  - Each block contains the hash of the *previous* block.
  - If you hack Block 2, its hash changes. Block 3 sees the mismatch and breaks.
- **Slide 3 (The Network):**
  - Every computer (Node) has a copy of the chain.
  - To hack it, you'd need to hack 51% of all computers at once. (Impossible).

## 5. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "Digital currency and cryptocurrency are exactly the same."
  - **Answer:** False. Crypto is decentralized; Digital currency is usually centralized.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "Blockchain data is stored on a single central server."
  - **Answer:** False. It is distributed across all computers in the network.
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "If you change data in a block, the hash remains the same."
  - **Answer:** False. The hash changes completely, breaking the chain.
