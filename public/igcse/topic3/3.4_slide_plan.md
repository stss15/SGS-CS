# Slide Plan: 3.4 Network Hardware

## Source Material
- **File:** `3.4.txt`
- **Topic:** NIC, MAC, IP, Routers

## Slide Structure

### 1. Title Slide
- **Main Title:** 3.4 Network Hardware
- **Sub-Title:** Topic 3: Hardware

### 2. The Big Question (Hook)
- **Concept:** The Postman.
- **Question:** How does a letter get to the right house in the right country?
- **Visual:** Envelope/Letter icon.
- **Key Idea:** You need an address (IP) and a door (MAC).

### 3. NIC (Network Interface Card)
- **Slide:** The Gateway.
- **Content:**
    - Hardware needed to connect to a network.
    - Can be wired or wireless (WNIC).
    - Contains the MAC address.

### 4. MAC Address (Media Access Control)
- **Slide:** The Fingerprint.
- **Content:**
    - **Physical** address.
    - Unique to the device (mostly).
    - Format: Hexadecimal (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
    - First half: Manufacturer ID. Second half: Serial Num.
    - Static (usually).

### 5. IP Address (Internet Protocol)
- **Slide:** The Location.
- **Content:**
    - **Logical** address.
    - Assigned by the network (Router/ISP).
    - **IPv4:** 192.168.1.1 (32-bit).
    - **IPv6:** Hexadecimal (128-bit) - because we ran out of IPv4!
    - **Static vs Dynamic:**
        - Static: Permanent (Servers).
        - Dynamic: Changes (Home devices, DHCP).

### 6. Routers
- **Slide:** The Traffic Cop.
- **Content:**
    - Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN/Internet).
    - Directs data packets to the right place.
    - Assigns private IP addresses (DHCP).

### 7. Plenary: True or False?
- **Slide:** Misconception Check.
- **Questions:**
    1.  "A MAC address changes when you move house." (False)
    2.  "IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses." (True)
    3.  "A router connects a LAN to the Internet." (True)
    4.  "You can have the same public IP as your neighbour." (False - usually)

## Interactive Elements
- **Visuals:** Envelope addressing analogy.
- **Code/Text:** Showing actual MAC and IP formats.
