                    Hardware is the physical machinery that makes computing possible. While software provides the
                    instructions,
                    hardware does the heavy lifting. In this massive unit, we explore everything from the microscopic
                    transistors
                    inside a CPU to the sensors, printers, and storage devices that allow computers to interact with the
                    physical world.
