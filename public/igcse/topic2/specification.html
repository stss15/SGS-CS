                    Data is frequently transferred from one device to another. The two devices could be in the same
                    building or thousands of kilometres away. Irrespective of the distance travelled, the transmission
                    of data needs to be considered carefully. In this unit, we explore how data travels, how we catch
                    errors during the journey, and how we keep it safe from prying eyes.

                        transfer).</li>
