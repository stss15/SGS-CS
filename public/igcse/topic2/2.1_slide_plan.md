# Slide Plan: 2.1 Data Transmission

**Goal:** Explain how data is transmitted (Serial vs Parallel, Simplex vs Duplex) and the role of USB.

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on "Traffic" analogies.

---

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 2.1 Data Transmission
  - Sub-title: Topic 2: Data Transmission
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Why is a motorway faster than a country lane?
  - **Visual:** A 4-lane highway vs a single-track road.
  - **Key Idea:** More lanes = More data at once. (Parallel vs Serial).

## 3. Types of Transmission (Direction)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Which way?
  - **Simplex:** One way only (Radio, TV).
  - **Half-Duplex:** Both ways, but one at a time (Walkie-Talkie).
  - **Full-Duplex:** Both ways simultaneously (Phone call, Internet).

## 4. Methods of Transmission (Lanes)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** How many lanes?
  - **Serial:** One bit at a time. Single wire.
  - **Parallel:** Multiple bits at once. Multiple wires.

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Serial vs Parallel
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Serial):**
  - **Pros:** Cheap, reliable over long distances, no skew.
  - **Cons:** Slower (historically).
  - **Use:** USB, Internet.
- **Slide 2 (Parallel):**
  - **Pros:** Fast (historically).
  - **Cons:** Expensive (thick cables), interference (crosstalk), skew (bits arriving at different times).
  - **Use:** Internal CPU buses, old printers.

## 5. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** The Universal Standard
  - **Definition:** An industry standard for connection, communication, and power.
  - **Key Feature:** It is **Serial**.

### 5.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Why USB Won
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Benefits):**
  - Impossible to plug in wrong (mostly).
  - Powers the device.
  - Drivers load automatically.
  - Backwards compatible.

## 6. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "Parallel transmission is always faster than serial."
  - **Answer:** False. Modern serial (USB-C, Fibre) is faster than old parallel because of synchronization issues (skew).
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "A walkie-talkie is an example of Full-Duplex."
  - **Answer:** False. It is Half-Duplex (Only one person can speak at a time).
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "USB stands for Universal Serial Bus."
  - **Answer:** True.
