# Slide Plan: 6.1 Automated Systems

**Goal:** Explain the Input-Process-Output loop in automation, the role of sensors, microprocessors, and actuators, and the advantages/disadvantages of automated systems.

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on the "Loop" (Feedback) and the "Why" (Safety/Efficiency).

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 6.1 Automated Systems
  - Sub-title: Topic 6: Automated & Emerging Technologies
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** How does a greenhouse water itself?
  - **Visual:** A split screen.
    - Left: A farmer checking soil manually.
    - Right: A moisture sensor connected to a sprinkler.
  - **Key Idea:** Automation removes the human from the loop.

## 3. The Automation Loop (Concept)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** The System
  - **Diagram:** Sensors (Input) -> Microprocessor (Process) -> Actuators (Output).
  - **Key Term:** Feedback Loop. (Output affects Input).

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: The Components
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Sensors):**
  - The "Eyes and Ears".
  - Examples: Temperature, Moisture, Light, Infra-red, pH.
  - **Action:** Send data (analogue) to the processor (digital). (Requires ADC).
- **Slide 2 (Microprocessor):**
  - The "Brain".
  - **Action:** Compares sensor data to a **Pre-set Value**.
  - **Decision:** IF data < preset THEN signal actuator.
- **Slide 3 (Actuators):**
  - The "Muscles".
  - Examples: Motor, Pump, Heater, Light Bulb, Valve.
  - **Action:** Physical movement or change.

## 4. Worked Example: Nuclear Power Plant
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Case Study: Nuclear Safety
  - **Scenario:** Controlling the temperature of a reactor.
  - **Why Automation?** Too dangerous/fast for humans.

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Step-by-Step
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Input):**
  - Temperature sensors monitor the core.
  - Send data to microprocessor.
- **Slide 2 (Process):**
  - Processor compares temp to "Max Safe Limit".
  - IF temp > limit THEN...
- **Slide 3 (Output):**
  - Signal actuators (Motors) to lower control rods.
  - Signal actuators (Pumps) to increase coolant flow.
  - **Feedback:** Temp drops -> Sensors read new lower temp -> Processor stops cooling.

## 5. Advantages & Disadvantages
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Pros and Cons
  - **Context:** Industry, Transport, Science.

### 5.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Evaluation
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Advantages):**
  - **Safety:** Humans kept away from danger (Nuclear, Chemicals).
  - **Speed:** Computers react in milliseconds.
  - **Consistency:** Exact same process every time.
  - **24/7:** No breaks, no sleep.
- **Slide 2 (Disadvantages):**
  - **Cost:** Expensive to set up and maintain.
  - **Inflexibility:** Can't "improvise" if something unexpected happens.
  - **Security:** Vulnerable to hacking.
  - **Jobs:** Replaces manual labour.

## 6. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "Sensors make the decisions in an automated system."
  - **Answer:** False. Sensors only measure. The Microprocessor decides.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "An actuator is an input device."
  - **Answer:** False. It's an output (it does the action).
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "Automated systems are always safer than humans."
  - **Answer:** True (mostly). They don't panic or get tired, but software bugs can exist.
- **Slide 5 (Q4):** "A feedback loop means the output changes the input."
  - **Answer:** True. (e.g., Heater turns on -> Room gets hot -> Sensor reads hot -> Heater turns off).
