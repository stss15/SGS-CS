# Slide Plan: 6.2 Robotics

**Goal:** Define what a robot is (Sense, Move, Programmable), distinguish between independent and dependent robots, and evaluate their use in industry, transport, agriculture, and the home.

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on "Characteristics" and "Impact".

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 6.2 Robotics
  - Sub-title: Topic 6: Automated & Emerging Technologies
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Is a washing machine a robot?
  - **Visual:** A washing machine vs a humanoid robot.
  - **Key Idea:** It has a program, it moves, it senses... but is it "intelligent" or just automated? The line is blurry.

## 3. What is a Robot? (Characteristics)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** The Three Pillars
  - **Definition:** A machine that can carry out complex actions automatically.
  - **The 3 Characteristics:**
    1.  **Sense:** Sensors (Input).
    2.  **Move:** Actuators/End-Effectors (Output).
    3.  **Programmable:** Controller (Process).

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Types of Robots
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Independent / Autonomous):**
  - No human intervention needed.
  - Examples: Mars Rover, Roomba, Autonomous Car.
  - Replaces the human totally.
- **Slide 2 (Dependent):**
  - Human interface required.
  - Examples: Robotic Surgery Arm (Surgeon controls it), Bomb Disposal Bot.
  - Supplements the human.

## 4. Robots in Industry
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** The Factory Floor
  - **Question:** Why do we hardly see humans in car factories?
  - **Tasks:** Welding, Spray Painting, Lifting, Assembly.

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Evaluation
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Advantages):**
  - **Consistency:** Perfect welds every time.
  - **Productivity:** 24/7 operation.
  - **Safety:** Handles toxic fumes/heavy loads.
- **Slide 2 (Disadvantages):**
  - **Unemployment:** Replaces low-skilled jobs.
  - **Deskilling:** Humans forget how to do the manual work.
  - **Cost:** High initial investment.

## 5. Robots in Transport (Autonomous Vehicles)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Driverless Future
  - **Tech:** LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), Radar, Cameras.
  - **Scenario:** A car approaching a red light.

### 5.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Pros & Cons
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Advantages):**
  - Safer (No human error/distraction).
  - Efficient (Smoother traffic flow).
  - Accessible (For elderly/disabled).
- **Slide 2 (Disadvantages):**
  - Hacking risks.
  - Ethical dilemmas (The Trolley Problem).
  - Legal liability (Who is to blame for a crash?).

## 6. Robots in Agriculture
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Smart Farming
  - **Tasks:** Harvesting, Weeding, Phenotyping (checking health).
  - **Example:** Drone swarms monitoring crops.

### 6.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Precision
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Weeding):**
  - Robots can zap individual weeds with lasers.
  - **Benefit:** Reduces chemical herbicide use (Eco-friendly).
- **Slide 2 (Harvesting):**
  - Robots use cameras to pick only ripe fruit.
  - **Benefit:** Less waste, higher yield.

## 7. Robots in Medicine & Home
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Personal & Professional
  - **Medicine:** Surgical arms (Precision), Prosthetics (Bionic limbs).
  - **Home:** Vacuum cleaners, Lawn mowers, Entertainment bots.

## 8. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "A drone controlled by a remote is an autonomous robot."
  - **Answer:** False. It is **dependent** (human controlled). Autonomous means it flies itself.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "Robots in industry increase the cost of products."
  - **Answer:** False. In the long run, they reduce costs (efficiency, no wages).
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "LiDAR is used by autonomous cars to build a 3D map."
  - **Answer:** True.
- **Slide 5 (Q4):** "A 'Chatbot' is a physical robot."
  - **Answer:** False. It is software (AI), not a robot (Physical).
