# 6.2 Robotics - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: What Makes a Robot?
- **Type**: Venn Diagram / 3-Pillar Visual
- **Description**: The three defining characteristics of a robot.
- **Prompt**: Create a visual defining "Characteristics of a Robot".
  - **Pillar 1: Sense**: Icon of an Eye/Sensor. Text: "Ability to sense surroundings (Inputs)."
  - **Pillar 2: Think (Process)**: Icon of a Brain/Chip. Text: "Programmable. Has a controller/microprocessor."
  - **Pillar 3: Act (Move)**: Icon of a Robot Arm/Wheel. Text: "Degree of movement. Uses actuators/motors."
  - **Central Text**: "A machine that combines these three is a Robot."

## Concept: Independent vs Dependent Robots
- **Type**: Comparison Visual
- **Description**: Distinguishing between autonomous and human-controlled robots.
- **Prompt**: Create a comparison of "Independent vs. Dependent Robots".
  - **Independent (Autonomous)**:
    - Visual: A Mars Rover or Roomba vacuum.
    - Text: "Works without human intervention. Replaces human activity."
    - Example: "Self-driving car, Planetary explorer."
  - **Dependent**:
    - Visual: A Surgeon using a robotic arm or Factory Worker with a cobot.
    - Text: "Requires human interface/control. Supplements human activity."
    - Example: "Surgical robot, Bomb disposal robot (remote controlled)."

## Concept: Robots in Industry
- **Type**: Annotated Diagram
- **Description**: A detailed look at a manufacturing robot.
- **Prompt**: Create an annotated diagram of an "Industrial Robot Arm".
  - **Base**: Fixed to the floor.
  - **Joints**: Label "Motors/Actuators" at the elbow and wrist. Text: "Allows movement/rotation."
  - **End-Effector**: The tool at the end. Show multiple interchangeable options:
    - "Gripper (for lifting)"
    - "Welder (for joining metal)"
    - "Spray Gun (for painting)"
  - **Sensors**: Small sensors on the arm. Label: "Pressure/Proximity Sensors (Safety)."

## Concept: Robots in Agriculture
- **Type**: Scenario Illustration
- **Description**: Showing how robots are used in farming.
- **Prompt**: Create a visual for "Agricultural Robots".
  - **Sky**: A Drone. Label: "Survey Drone. Maps crop health. Sprays fertilizer."
  - **Ground**: An autonomous tractor or harvester. Label: "Automated Harvester. Uses GPS to navigate. Picks only ripe fruit."
  - **Benefits Box**: "Higher yield, less labor, 24/7 operation, precision farming."
