# 7.1 Program Development Life Cycle - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: The Program Development Life Cycle
- **Type**: Cycle Diagram
- **Description**: The iterative process of creating software.
- **Prompt**: Create a 5-stage cycle diagram for "Program Development Life Cycle".
  - **Stage 1: Analysis**: Icon of a Magnifying Glass. Text: "Define problem. Abstraction & Decomposition."
  - **Stage 2: Design**: Icon of a Blueprint/Flowchart. Text: "Plan solution. Structure charts, Flowcharts, Pseudocode."
  - **Stage 3: Coding**: Icon of `</>` or Computer Screen. Text: "Write the program (Python, VB, Java)."
  - **Stage 4: Testing**: Icon of a Tick/Bug. Text: "Find and fix errors. Use Test Data."
  - **Stage 5: Maintenance**: Icon of a Wrench. Text: "Update and fix issues after release."
  - **Arrows**: Show a continuous loop, especially between Coding and Testing.

## Concept: Decomposition
- **Type**: Visual Analogy / Tree Diagram
- **Description**: Breaking a complex problem into smaller parts.
- **Prompt**: Create a decomposition tree for a real-world task: "Making a Cup of Tea".
  - **Top Level**: Box labeled "Make Tea".
  - **Level 2**: Three branches:
    - "Boil Water" (Sub-task 1)
    - "Prepare Mug" (Sub-task 2)
    - "Combine" (Sub-task 3)
  - **Level 3 (under Boil Water)**: "Fill Kettle", "Switch On", "Wait".
  - **Level 3 (under Prepare Mug)**: "Get Mug", "Add Teabag", "Add Sugar".
  - **Key Text**: "Decomposition: Breaking a large problem into manageable sub-problems."
