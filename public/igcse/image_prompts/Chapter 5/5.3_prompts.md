# 5.3 Cyber Security - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: Types of Malware
- **Type**: Icon Infographic
- **Description**: Visualizing different types of malicious software.
- **Prompt**: Create an infographic titled "Common Malware Types".
  - **Virus**: Icon: Green bug/germ attached to a file. Text: "Replicates by attaching to files. Needs human action to spread."
  - **Worm**: Icon: Worm crawling through a network cable. Text: "Self-replicating. Spreads through networks automatically. No human action needed."
  - **Trojan Horse**: Icon: Wooden Horse. Text: "Disguised as legitimate software. Opens a backdoor for hackers."
  - **Spyware**: Icon: Eye or Detective. Text: "Secretly records user activity (keylogger, webcam)."
  - **Adware**: Icon: Pop-up ads. Text: "Displays unwanted advertisements. Can slow down performance."
  - **Ransomware**: Icon: Locked screen with $ sign. Text: "Locks data/files. Demands payment for the decryption key."

## Concept: Phishing vs Pharming
- **Type**: Comparison Visual
- **Description**: Distinguishing between two common scams.
- **Prompt**: Create a comparison of "Phishing vs. Pharming".
  - **Phishing (The Bait)**:
    - Visual: An email with a hook.
    - Method: "Sending fake emails (e.g., from 'Bank') to trick users into clicking links."
    - Goal: "Steal personal data (passwords, credit cards)."
    - Prevention: "Check sender email, spelling errors, don't click suspicious links."
  - **Pharming (The Redirect)**:
    - Visual: A road sign pointing the wrong way.
    - Method: "Malicious code on a server redirects users to a fake website (even if they type the correct URL)."
    - Goal: "Steal personal data via fake site."
    - Prevention: "Check for HTTPS/Padlock, use ISP filters."

## Concept: Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
- **Type**: System Diagram
- **Description**: Visualizing how a DDoS attack crashes a server.
- **Prompt**: Create a diagram for a "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack".
  - **Attacker**: Icon of a hacker.
  - **Botnet**: Group of infected computers (Zombies) controlled by the hacker.
  - **Target**: A central Server.
  - **Action**: Arrows from all Botnet computers flooding the Target Server with requests.
  - **Result**: Server icon with "X" eyes or smoke. Text: "Server Overloaded. Cannot respond to legitimate requests."

## Concept: Biometric Security
- **Type**: Visual List
- **Description**: Common biometric authentication methods.
- **Prompt**: Create a visual list of "Biometric Authentication".
  - **Fingerprint**: Icon of a fingerprint. Text: "Unique pattern of ridges. Common on phones."
  - **Retina Scan**: Icon of an eye. Text: "Scans blood vessel patterns in the eye. Very high security."
  - **Face Recognition**: Icon of a face frame. Text: "Maps facial features. Convenient but can be affected by lighting/glasses."
  - **Voice Recognition**: Icon of sound waves. Text: "Analyses voice patterns. Can be affected by illness/background noise."
  - **Pros**: "Unique to individual, hard to fake, always with you."
  - **Cons**: "Privacy concerns, expensive setup."

## Concept: Two-Step Verification
- **Type**: 3-Step Flowchart
- **Description**: The process of adding an extra layer of security.
- **Prompt**: Create a flowchart for "Two-Step Verification".
  - **Step 1**: "User enters Password." (Something you know).
  - **Step 2**: "System sends a code to User's Phone." (Something you have).
  - **Step 3**: "User enters the code to login."
  - **Benefit**: "Even if a hacker steals your password, they cannot login without your phone."

## Concept: Access Levels
- **Type**: Pyramid Diagram
- **Description**: Hierarchical access rights in an organization.
- **Prompt**: Create a pyramid diagram for "Data Access Levels".
  - **Top Level (Admin)**: "Full Access. Read/Write/Delete all files. Install software."
  - **Middle Level (Manager)**: "Read/Write department files. Cannot install software."
  - **Bottom Level (Employee)**: "Read-only access to specific files. Restricted permissions."
  - **Purpose**: "Prevents unauthorized access and accidental deletion of sensitive data."
