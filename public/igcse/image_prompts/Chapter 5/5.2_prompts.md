# 5.2 Digital Currency and Blockchain - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: Digital Currency vs Fiat Currency
- **Type**: Comparison Table
- **Description**: Contrasting traditional money with digital currency.
- **Prompt**: Create a comparison table for "Fiat Currency vs. Digital Currency".
  - **Fiat Currency**:
    - Icon: Banknotes/Coins.
    - Physical Form: "Yes (Cash, Coins)."
    - Control: "Centralized (Controlled by Governments/Central Banks)."
    - Regulation: "Heavily regulated."
    - Anonymity: "Cash is anonymous; Bank transfers are traceable."
  - **Digital Currency (Cryptocurrency)**:
    - Icon: Bitcoin symbol / Digital Code.
    - Physical Form: "No (Exists only as data)."
    - Control: "Decentralized (No central authority/bank)."
    - Regulation: "Self-regulated by community/code (often)."
    - Anonymity: "Varies (Transactions are public on blockchain, but identity can be hidden)."

## Concept: Anatomy of a Blockchain Block
- **Type**: Anatomy Diagram
- **Description**: Visualizing the components of a single block in a blockchain.
- **Prompt**: Create a diagram showing the "Structure of a Block".
  - **The Block**: A 3D cube or box.
  - **Content 1: Data**: Label "Transaction Data". Text: "Sender, Receiver, Amount."
  - **Content 2: Hash**: Label "Current Hash". Text: "Unique digital fingerprint of this block (e.g., A1B2...)."
  - **Content 3: Previous Hash**: Label "Previous Hash". Text: "Link to the block before it. This creates the 'Chain'."
  - **Visual Connection**: Show an arrow pointing from "Previous Hash" to a faded block behind it.

## Concept: How Blockchain Works (The Chain)
- **Type**: Process Diagram
- **Description**: Showing how blocks link together and why it's secure.
- **Prompt**: Create a diagram titled "The Blockchain: An Unbreakable Chain".
  - **Block 1 (Genesis)**: Hash: "AAAA". Prev Hash: "0000".
  - **Block 2**: Hash: "BBBB". Prev Hash: "AAAA". (Arrow connecting Prev Hash to Block 1).
  - **Block 3**: Hash: "CCCC". Prev Hash: "BBBB". (Arrow connecting Prev Hash to Block 2).
  - **Security Feature**: Add a "Hacker" icon trying to change Block 2.
    - Annotation: "Tampering with Block 2 changes its Hash. This breaks the link to Block 3 (which expects the old hash). The chain becomes invalid."
  - **Key Text**: "Distributed Ledger: Everyone has a copy. Changes must be approved by the network."

## Concept: Cryptocurrency Transaction Process
- **Type**: Flowchart
- **Description**: The lifecycle of a crypto transaction.
- **Prompt**: Create a step-by-step flowchart for a "Cryptocurrency Transaction".
  - **Step 1**: User A requests a transaction to User B.
  - **Step 2**: The transaction is broadcast to the P2P network (nodes).
  - **Step 3**: The network validates the transaction using algorithms (Mining).
  - **Step 4**: The transaction is combined with others to create a new Block.
  - **Step 5**: The new Block is added to the existing Blockchain (permanent and unalterable).
  - **Step 6**: The transaction is complete. Money moves from A to B.
