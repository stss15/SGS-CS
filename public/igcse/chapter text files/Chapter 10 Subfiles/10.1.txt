10.1 Standard logic gate symbols
Electronic circuits in computers, solid state drives and controlling devices
are made up of thousands of logic gates. Logic gates take binary inputs
and produce a binary output. Several logic gates combined together form a
logic circuit and these circuits are designed to carry out a specific function.
The checking of the output from a logic gate or logic circuit is done using a
truth table.
This chapter will consider the function and role of logic gates, logic
circuits and truth tables. Also a number of possible applications of logic
circuits will be considered. A reference to Boolean algebra will be made
throughout the chapter; but this is really outside the scope of this text book.
However, Boolean algebra will be seen on many logic gate websites and
is included here for completeness, since many students may prefer this
notation to logic statements.

10.1.1 Logic gate symbols
Six different logic gates will be considered in this chapter:

NOT gate

AND gate

OR gate

NAND gate

NOR gate

XOR gate

Truth tables
Truth tables are used to trace the output from a logic gate or logic circuit. The
NOT gate is the only logic gate with one input; the other five gates have two
inputs (see Figure 10.1).
Although each logic gate can only have one or two inputs, the number of
inputs to a logic circuit can be more than 2; for example, three inputs give a
possible 23 (=8) binary combinations. And for four inputs, the number of possible
binary combinations is 24 (=16). It is clear that the number of possible binary
combinations is a multiple of the number 2 in every case. The possible inputs in
a truth table can be summarised as shown in Table 10.1.

10 Boolean logic

As we can see, a truth table will also list the output for every possible
combination of inputs.
