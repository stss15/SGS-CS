Key terms used throughout this chapter
analysis – part of the program development life cycle; a
process of investigation, leading to the specification of what
a program is required to do
design – part of the program development life cycle; uses
the program specification from the analysis stage to show
to how the program should be developed
coding – part of the program development life cycle; the
writing of the program or suite of programs
testing – part of the program development life cycle;
systematic checks done on a program to make sure that it
works under all conditions
abstraction – a method used in the analysis stage of
the program development life cycle; the key elements
required for the solution to the problem are kept and any
unnecessary details and information that are not required
are discarded
decomposition – a method used in the analysis stage of
the program development life cycle; a complex problem
is broken down into smaller parts, which can then be
sub divided into even smaller parts that can be solved
more easily
top-down design – the breaking down of a computer
system into a set of sub-systems, then breaking each subsystem down into a set of smaller sub-systems, until each
sub-system just performs a single action
inputs – the data used by the system that needs to be
entered while the system is active
processes – the tasks that need to be performed by a
program using the input data and any other previously
stored data
output – information that needs to be displayed or printed
for the users of the system
storage – data that needs to be stored in files on an
appropriate media for use in the future
structure diagram – a diagram that shows the design of
a computer system in a hierarchical way, with each level
giving a more detailed breakdown of the system into subsystems
flowchart – a diagram that shows the steps required for a
task (sub-system) and the order in which the steps are to be
performed
algorithm – an ordered set of steps to solve a problem

pseudocode – a simple method of showing an
algorithm; it describes what the algorithm does by using
English key words that are very similar to those used in a
high-level programming language but without the strict
syntax rules
linear search – an algorithm that inspects each item in a
list in turn to see if the item matches the value searched for
bubble sort – an algorithm that makes multiple passes
through a list comparing each element with the next
element and swapping them. This continues until there is a
pass where no more swaps are made
validation – automated checks carried out by a program
that data is reasonable before it is accepted into a computer
system
verification – checking that data has been accurately
copied from another source and input into a computer
or transferred from one part of a computer system to
another
set of test data – all the items of data required to work
through a solution
normal data – data that is accepted by a program
abnormal data – data that is rejected by a program
extreme data – the largest/smallest data value that is
accepted by a program
boundary data – the largest/smallest data value that is
accepted by a program and the corresponding smallest/
largest rejected data value
range check – a check that the value of a number is
between an upper value and a lower value
length check – a method used to check that the data
entered is a specific number of characters long or that the
number of characters is between an upper value and a
lower value
type check – a check that the data entered is of a specific
type
presence check – a check that a data item has been
entered
format check – a check that the characters entered
conform to a pre-defined pattern
check digit – an additional digit appended to a number to
check if the entered number is error-free; check digit is a
data entry check and not a data transmission check
