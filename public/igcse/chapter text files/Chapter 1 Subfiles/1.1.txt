1.1 Number systems
1.1.1 Binary represents data
As you progress through this book you will begin to realise how complex
computer systems really are. By the time you reach Chapter 10 you should have a
better understanding of the fundamentals behind computers themselves and the
software that controls them.
You will learn that any form of data needs to be converted into a binary format
so that it can be processed by the computer.
However, no matter how complex the system, the basic building block in all
computers is the binary number system. This system is chosen because it only
consists of 1s and 0s. Since computers contain millions and millions of tiny
‘switches’, which must be in the ON or OFF position, they can be represented by
the binary system. A switch in the ON position is represented by 1; a switch in
the OFF position is represented by 0.

1.1 Number systems

Switches used in a computer make use of logic gates (see Chapter 10) and are
used to store and process data.

1.1.2 Binary, denary and hexadecimal systems
The binary system
We are all familiar with the denary number system which counts in multiples of 10.
This gives us the well-known headings of units, 10s, 100s, 1000s, and so on:
