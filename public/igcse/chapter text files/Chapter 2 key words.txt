Key terms used throughout this chapter
data packet – a small part of a message/data that is transmitted over a network; after
transmission all the data packets are reassembled to form the original message/data
packet header – the part of the data packet that contains the IP addresses of the sender
and receiver, and includes the packet number which allows reassembly of the data packets
packet trailer – the part of a data packet that indicates the end of the data packet and cyclic
redundancy check error check
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) – an error checking method in which all the 1-bits in
the data packet payload are added and the total is stored in the packet trailer; the same
calculation is repeated at the receiving station
payload – the actual data being carried in a data packet
node – stages in a network that can receive and transmit data packets; routers are nodes in
communication networks
packet switching – a method of transmission in which a message is broken into many data
packets which can then be sent along pathways independently of each other
router – a device that enables data packets to be moved between different networks, for
example to join a LAN to a WAN
real time streaming – the transmission of data over a network for live events where the
data is sent as soon as it is received or generated
hopping/hop number – a number in a data packet header used to stop data packets that
never reach their destination from ‘clogging up’ the data paths/routes
simplex – data that can be sent on one direction only
half-duplex – data that can be sent in both directions but not at the same time
full-duplex – data that can be sent in both directions at the same time (simultaneously)
serial data transmission – sending data down one channel/wire one bit at a time
parallel data transmission – sending data down several channels/wires several bits at a
time (usually 1 byte)
skewed (data) – data that arrives at the destination with the bits no longer synchronised
universal serial bus (USB) – a type of serial data transmission which has become the
industry standard for connecting computers to devices via a USB port
parity check – a method used to check if data has been transferred correctly; it makes use
of even parity (an even number of 1-bits) or odd parity (an odd number of 1-bits)
parity bit – a bit (either 0 or 1) added to a byte of data in the most significant bit position;
this ensures that the byte follows the correct even parity or odd parity protocol
parity block – a horizontal and vertical parity check on a block of data being transmitted
parity byte – an extra byte of data sent at the end of a parity block; it is composed of the
parity bits generated from a vertical parity check of the data block
checksum – a verification method used to check if data transferred has been altered or
corrupted; calculated from the block of data of data being sent; the checksum value is sent
after each data block

2 Data transmission

automatic repeat request (ARQ) – a method of checking transmitted data for errors; it
makes use of acknowledgement and timeout to automatically request re-sending of data if
the time interval before positive acknowledgement is too long
acknowledgement – a message sent to the receiver indicating that data has been received
correctly (used in the ARQ error detection method)
timeout – the time interval allowed to elapse before an acknowledgement is received (in
the ARQ error detection method)
echo check – a method used to check if data has been transferred correctly; data is sent
to a receiver and then immediately sent back to the sender; the sender then checks if the
received data matches the sent data
check digit – an additional digit appended to a number to check if the entered number is
error-free; check digit is a data entry check and not a data transmission check
eavesdropper – another name for a hacker who intercepts data being transmitted on a
wired or wireless network
encryption – the process of making data meaningless using encryption keys; without the
correct decryption key the data cannot be decoded (unscrambled)
plaintext – the original text/message before it is put through an encryption algorithm
ciphertext – encrypted data that is the result of putting a plaintext message through an
encryption algorithm
encryption algorithm – a complex piece of software that takes plaintext and generates an
encrypted string known as ciphertext
symmetric encryption – a type of encryption in which the same encryption key is used both
to encrypt and decrypt a message
asymmetric encryption – a type of encryption that uses public keys and private keys to
ensure data is secure
public key – a type of encryption key that is known to all users
private key – a type of encryption key which is known only to the single computer/user
quantum computer – a computer that can perform very fast calculations; it can perform
calculations that are based on probability rather than simple 0 or 1 values; this gives
a quantum computer the potential to process considerably more data than existing
computers
