7.9 Writing and amending algorithms
There are a number of stages when producing an algorithm for a given problem:
1 Make sure that the problem is clearly specified – the purpose of the algorithm
and the tasks to be completed by the algorithm.
2 Break the problem down in to sub-problems; if it is complex, you may want to
consider writing an algorithm for each sub-problem. Most problems, even the
simplest ones can be divided into:
– Set up processes
– Input
– Processing of data
– Permanent storage of data (if required)
– Output of results.
3 Decide on how any data is to be obtained and stored, what is going to happen
to the data and how any results are going to be displayed.
4 Design the structure of your algorithm using a structure diagram.
5 Decide on how you are going to construct your algorithm, either using a
flowchart or pseudocode. If you are told how to construct your algorithm,
then follow the guidance.
6 Construct your algorithm, making sure that it can be easily read and
understood by someone else. Precision is required when writing algorithms,
just as it is when writing program code. This involves setting it out clearly
and using meaningful names for any data stores. Take particular care with
conditions used for loops and selection, for example 'Counter >= 10' rather
than 'Counter ten or over'. The algorithms that you have looked at so far in
this chapter were not designed with readability in mind because you needed
to work out what the problem being solved was.
7 Use several sets of test data (Normal, Abnormal and Boundary) to dry run your
algorithm and show the results in trace tables, to enable you to find any errors.
8 If any errors are found, correct them and repeat the process until you think
that your algorithm works perfectly.
Have a look at this structure diagram and flowchart for the algorithm to select
the largest, Max, and smallest, Min, numbers from a list of ten numbers. This
time the flowchart is more easily readable than the structure chart:

Example 1: Writing algorithms in pseudocode
Tickets are sold for a concert at $20 each. If 10 tickets are bought then the discount is 10%,
if 20 tickets are bought the discount is 20%. No more than 25 tickets can be bought in a
single transaction.
a Use pseudocode to write the algorithm to calculate the cost of buying a given number
of tickets.

For the test data given in Example 1, identify the type of test data used and
suggest some more test data and dry run the algorithm.

Example 2: Writing algorithms in pseudocode

Comments are used to
make the algorithm
more understandable

A school with 600 students wants to produce some information from the results of the
four standard tests in Maths, Science, English and IT. Each test is out of 100 marks.
The information output should be the highest, lowest and average mark for each test
and the highest, lowest and average mark overall. All the marks need to be input.
a Use pseudocode to write the algorithm to complete this task.
b Explain how you would test your algorithm.

Activity 7.19
1 Identify the changes you would need to make to the algorithm in Example 2 to
reduce the number of students to 5 and the number of subjects to 2.
Identify the test data needed to test Example 2 with the reduced number of
students and subjects.
2 With the set of test data you have chosen set up, complete a trace table so that
you can compare your expected results with the actual results when you dry
run the algorithm.

Activity 7.20
1 Write pseudocode to input ten positive numbers and find the total and the
average.
2 Write pseudocode to input any number of positive numbers and find the total
and the average. The user should enter ‘-1’ when they have finished entering
their list of positive numbers.
3 Explain why you chose the loop structure for each task.

Extension
For those students interested in studying computer science at A Level, the
following section is an introduction to the use of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) to
store data in stacks and queues.
An ADT is a collection of data and a set of operations on that data. For example, a
stack includes the items held on the stack and the operations to add an item to the
stack (push) or remove an item from the stack (pop):
» stack – a list containing several items operating on the Last In First Out (LIFO)
principle. Items can be added to the stack (push) and removed from the stack
(pop). The first item added to a stack is the last item to be removed from the
stack.
» queue – a list containing several items operating on the First In First Out (FIFO)
principle. Items can be added to the queue (enqueue) and removed from the
queue (dequeue). The first item added to a queue is the first item to be removed
from the queue.

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

Key terms used throughout this chapter
analysis – part of the program development life cycle; a
process of investigation, leading to the specification of what
a program is required to do
design – part of the program development life cycle; uses
the program specification from the analysis stage to show
to how the program should be developed
coding – part of the program development life cycle; the
writing of the program or suite of programs
testing – part of the program development life cycle;
systematic checks done on a program to make sure that it
works under all conditions
abstraction – a method used in the analysis stage of
the program development life cycle; the key elements
required for the solution to the problem are kept and any
unnecessary details and information that are not required
are discarded
decomposition – a method used in the analysis stage of
the program development life cycle; a complex problem
is broken down into smaller parts, which can then be
sub divided into even smaller parts that can be solved
more easily
top-down design – the breaking down of a computer
system into a set of sub-systems, then breaking each subsystem down into a set of smaller sub-systems, until each
sub-system just performs a single action
inputs – the data used by the system that needs to be
entered while the system is active
processes – the tasks that need to be performed by a
program using the input data and any other previously
stored data
output – information that needs to be displayed or printed
for the users of the system
storage – data that needs to be stored in files on an
appropriate media for use in the future
structure diagram – a diagram that shows the design of
a computer system in a hierarchical way, with each level
giving a more detailed breakdown of the system into subsystems
flowchart – a diagram that shows the steps required for a
task (sub-system) and the order in which the steps are to be
performed
algorithm – an ordered set of steps to solve a problem

pseudocode – a simple method of showing an
algorithm; it describes what the algorithm does by using
English key words that are very similar to those used in a
high-level programming language but without the strict
syntax rules
linear search – an algorithm that inspects each item in a
list in turn to see if the item matches the value searched for
bubble sort – an algorithm that makes multiple passes
through a list comparing each element with the next
element and swapping them. This continues until there is a
pass where no more swaps are made
validation – automated checks carried out by a program
that data is reasonable before it is accepted into a computer
system
verification – checking that data has been accurately
copied from another source and input into a computer
or transferred from one part of a computer system to
another
set of test data – all the items of data required to work
through a solution
normal data – data that is accepted by a program
abnormal data – data that is rejected by a program
extreme data – the largest/smallest data value that is
accepted by a program
boundary data – the largest/smallest data value that is
accepted by a program and the corresponding smallest/
largest rejected data value
range check – a check that the value of a number is
between an upper value and a lower value
length check – a method used to check that the data
entered is a specific number of characters long or that the
number of characters is between an upper value and a
lower value
type check – a check that the data entered is of a specific
type
presence check – a check that a data item has been
entered
format check – a check that the characters entered
conform to a pre-defined pattern
check digit – an additional digit appended to a number to
check if the entered number is error-free; check digit is a
data entry check and not a data transmission check
