7.1 The program development life cycle
The program development life cycle is divided into five stages: analysis, design,
coding, testing and maintenance. This chapter and Chapter 8 will discuss the four
stages listed below:
» analysis
» design
» coding
» testing

7.1.1 Analysis
Before any problem can be solved, it needs to be clearly defined and set out so
anyone working on the solution understands what is needed. This is called the
‘requirements specification’ for the program. The analysis stage uses abstraction
and decomposition tools to identify exactly what is required from the program.
Abstraction keeps the key elements required for the solution to the problem
and discards any unnecessary details and information that is not required. For
example, a map only shows what is required for travelling from one place to
another. Different methods of transport will require different types of map.

Decompose getting
dressed further, it can
get quite complicated
to show all the details
required.

Decomposition breaks down a complex problem into smaller parts, which can
then be subdivided into even smaller parts, that can be solved easily. Any daily
task can be divided into its constituent parts.
For example, getting dressed:
» Select items to wear
» Remove any clothes being worn
» Put selected items on in order.

7.1.2 Design
The program specification from the analysis stage is used to show to how
the program should be developed. When the design stage is complete, the
programmer should know what is to be done, i.e. all the tasks that need to be
completed, how each task is to be performed and how the tasks work together.
This can be formally documented using structure charts, flowcharts and
pseudocode – see Section 7.2.

7.1.3 Coding and iterative testing
The program or set of programs is developed. Each module of the program is
written using a suitable programming language and then tested to see if it
works. Iterative testing means that modular tests are conducted, code amended,
and tests repeated until the module performs as required.

7.1.4 Testing
The completed program or set of programs is run many times with different sets
of test data. This ensures that all the tasks completed work together as specified
in the program design.
