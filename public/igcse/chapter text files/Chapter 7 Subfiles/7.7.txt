7.7 Trace tables to document dry runs of
algorithms
A thorough structured approach is required to find out the purpose of an
algorithm. This involves recording and studying the results from each step in the
algorithm and requires the use of test data.

7.7 Trace tables to document dry runs of algorithms

Worked example
Consider the algorithm represented by the following flowchart:
START

A ← 0
B ← 0
C ← 100

INPUT X

X > B?

yes

B ← X

yes

C ← X

no

X < C?
no
A ← A + 1

yes

A < 10?

no
OUTPUT B, C

STOP

A trace table can be used to record the results
from each step in an algorithm; it is used to record
the value of an item (variable) each time that it
changes. The manual exercise of working through
an algorithm step by step is called a dry run.

OUTPUT

A trace table is set up with a column for each
variable and a column for any output. For example:
Test data is then used to dry run the flowchart and record the results on the trace
table. During a dry run:
» every time the value of a variable is changed, the new value is entered in that
column of the trace table
» every time a value is output, the value is shown in the output column.
Test data: 9, 7, 3, 12, 6, 4, 15, 2, 8, 5

Activity 7.12
Use a trace table and the test data 400, 800, 190, 170, 300, 110, 600, 150, 130,
900 to record another dry run of the highest and lowest number flowchart from
Section 7.7.
It can be seen from the output that the algorithm selects the largest and the smallest
numbers from a list of ten positive numbers. The same trace table could have been
used if the algorithm had been shown using pseudocode:
A ← 0
B ← 0
C ← 100
OUTPUT "Enter your ten values"
REPEAT

Often questions will
use variables with a
single letter, instead of
a meaningful identifier,
and could ask what
the purpose of the
algorithm is!

INPUT X
IF X > B
THEN
B ← X
ENDIF
IF X < C
THEN

This prompt needs
to be shown as the first
output. No quotation
marks should be shown
in the output column

C ← X
ENDIF
A ← A + 1
UNTIL A = 10
OUTPUT B, C
