7.2 Computer systems, sub-systems and
decomposition
A computer system is made up of software, data, hardware, communications
and people; each computer system can be divided up into a set of sub-systems.
Each sub-system can be further divided into sub-systems and so on until each
sub-system just performs a single action.

Find at least five
computer systems you
frequently use in your
daily life; see if you can
decide the size of each
system.

Computer systems can be very large, very small or any size in between; most
people interact with many different computer systems during their daily life
without realising it.
For example, when you wake up in the morning, you might use an app on your
smartphone for your alarm, then you might check the weather forecast on your
computer before driving to work.
The alarm program is a very small computer system but when you check the
weather forecast, you obtain the information you need from one of the largest
computer systems in the world.

7.2.1 The computer system and its sub-systems
In order to understand how a computer system is built up and how it works it is
often divided up into sub-systems. This division can be shown using top-down
design to produce structure diagrams that demonstrate the modular construction of
the system. Each sub-system can be developed by a programmer as a sub-routine.
How each sub-routine works can be shown by using flowcharts or pseudocode.
Top-down design is the decomposition of a computer system into a set of subsystems, then breaking each sub-system down into a set of smaller sub-systems,
until each sub-system just performs a single action. This is an effective way
of designing a computer system to provide a solution to a problem, since each
part of the problem is broken down into smaller more manageable problems. The
process of breaking down into smaller sub-systems is called stepwise refinement.
This structured approach works for the development of both large and small
computer systems. When larger computer systems are being developed this means
that several programmers can work independently to develop and test different
sub-systems for the same system at the same time. This reduces the development
and testing time.

7.2.2 Decomposing a problem
Any problem that uses a computer system for its solution needs to be
decomposed into its component parts. The component parts of any computer
system are:
» inputs – the data used by the system that needs to be entered while the
system is active
» processes – the tasks that need to be performed using the input data and any
other previously stored data
» outputs – information that needs to be displayed or printed for the users of
the system
» storage – data that needs to be stored in files on an appropriate medium for
use in the future.

7.2 Computer systems, sub-systems and decomposition

Example 1: An alarm app
For example, the alarm app can be decomposed into:
» inputs – time to set the alarm, remove a previously set alarm time, switch an
alarm off, press snooze button
» processes – continuously check if the current time matches an alarm time that has
been set, storage and removal of alarm times, management of snooze
» outputs – continuous sound/tune (at alarm time or after snooze time expired)
» storage – time(s) for alarms set.

Activity 7.1
Using one of the computer systems that you identified, decompose it into its
component parts of inputs, processes, outputs and storage.

7.2.3 Methods used to design and construct a solution
to a problem
Solutions to problems need to be designed and developed rigorously. The use of
formal methods enables the process to be clearly shown for others to understand
the proposed solution. The following methods need to be used by IGCSE
Computer Science students:
» structure diagrams
» flowcharts
» pseudocode.

Structure diagrams
Structure diagrams can be used to show top-down design in a diagrammatic
form. Structure diagrams are hierarchical, showing how a computer system
solution can be divided into sub-systems with each level giving a more detailed
breakdown. If necessary, each sub-system can be further divided.

Example 2: Alarm app for a smart phone
Consider the alarm app computer system for a smart phone; this could be divided
into three sub-systems, setting the alarm, checking for the alarm time, sounding the
alarm. These sub-systems could then be further sub-divided; a structure diagram
makes the process clearer.

Flowcharts
A flowchart shows diagrammatically the steps required to complete a task and
the order that they are to be performed. These steps, together with the order, are
called an algorithm. Flowcharts are an effective way to communicate how the
algorithm that makes up a system or sub-system works.

7.2 Computer systems, sub-systems and decomposition

Pseudocode
Pseudocode is a simple method of showing an algorithm. It describes what the
algorithm does by using English key words that are very similar to those used in
a high-level programming language. Data items to be processed by the algorithm
are given meaningful names in the same way that variables and constants are in
a high-level programming language. However, pseudocode is not bound by the
strict syntax rules of a programming language. It does what its name says, it
pretends to be programming code!
To ensure that pseudocode is easily understandable by others it is useful to be
consistent in the way that it is written.
The pseudocode in this book is written in the following way to match the
pseudocode given in the IGCSE Computer Science syllabus and to help you
understand the algorithms more easily:
» a non-proportional font is used throughout
» all keywords (words used to describe a specific action e.g. INPUT) are written
in capital letters
» all names given to data items and subroutines start with a capital letter
» where conditional and loop statements are used, repeated or selected
statements are indented by two spaces.
The pseudocode for an assignment statement
A value is assigned to an item/variable using the ¨ operator. The variable on the
left of the ¨ is assigned the value of the expression on the right. The expression
on the right can be a single value or several values combined with any of the
following mathematical operators.

Examples of pseudocode assignment statements:

Tax has the value 2.4

SellingPrice ¨ Price + Tax

SellingPrice has the value 22.4

Gender ¨ "M"

Gender has the value M

Chosen ¨ False

Chosen has the value False

Activity 7.3
What values will the following variables have after the assignments have been
completed?
Amount ← 100
TotalPrice ← Amount * 3.5
Discount ← 0.2
FinalPrice ← TotalPrice – TotalPrice * Discount
Name ← "Nikki"
Message ← "Hello " + Name

The pseudocode for conditional statements
When different actions are performed by an algorithm according to the values of
the variables, conditional statements can be used to decide which action should
be taken.

There are two types of conditional statement:
1 a condition that can be true or false such as: IF … THEN … ELSE … ENDIF
IF Age < 18
THEN
OUTPUT "Child"
ELSE
OUTPUT "Adult"
ENDIF

2 a choice between several different values, such as: CASE OF …
OTHERWISE … ENDCASE
CASE OF Grade
"A" : OUTPUT "Excellent"
"B" : OUTPUT "Good"
"C" : OUTPUT "Average"
OTHERWISE OUTPUT "Improvement is needed"
ENDCASE

IF … THEN … ELSE … ENDIF
For an IF condition the THEN path is followed if the condition is true and the
ELSE path is followed if the condition is false. There may or may not be an
ELSE path. The end of the statement is shown by ENDIF.

7.2 Computer systems, sub-systems and decomposition

There are different ways that an IF condition can be set up:
» use of a Boolean variable that can have the value TRUE or FALSE (see
Chapter 8 for details of Boolean variables). For example:
IF Found
THEN
OUTPUT "Your search was successful"
ELSE
OUTPUT "Your search was unsuccessful"
ENDIF

» comparisons made by using comparison operators, where comparisons are
made from left to right, for example: A > B means ‘A is greater than B’
Comparisons can be simple or more complicated, for example:
IF ((Height > 1) OR (Weight > 20)) AND (Age < 70) AND
(Age > 5)
THEN
OUTPUT "You can ride"
ELSE
OUTPUT "Too small, too young or too old"
ENDIF

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

Have a look at the algorithm below that checks if a percentage mark is valid and
whether it is a pass or a fail. This makes use of two IF statements; the second
IF statement is part of the first ELSE path. This is called a nested IF.

Programming is
covered in Chapter 8.
When you have started
your programming,
write and test a
program for this
algorithm.

OUTPUT "Please enter a mark "
INPUT PercentageMark
IF PercentageMark < 0 OR PercentageMark > 100
THEN
OUTPUT "Invalid Mark"

A rejected
percentage mark
must be either
less than zero or
greater than 100

ELSE
IF PercentageMark > 49
THEN
OUTPUT "Pass"
ELSE
OUTPUT "Fail"
ENDIF
ENDIF

This is a nested IF
statement, shown
clearly by the use
of a second level
of indentation. The
percentage mark
is only tested if it
is in the correct
range

Activity 7.4
Re-write the algorithm to check for a mark between 0 and 20 and a pass mark of 10.

CASE OF … OTHERWISE … ENDCASE
For a CASE statement the value of the variable decides the path to be taken.
Several values are usually specified. OTHERWISE is the path taken for all other
values. The end of the statement is shown by ENDCASE.

Have a look at the algorithm below that specifies what happens if the value of
Choice is 1, 2, 3 or 4.
CASE OF Choice
1 : Answer ← Num1 + Num2
2 : Answer ← Num1 - Num2
3 : Answer ← Num1 * Num2
4 : Answer ← Num1 / Num2
OTHERWISE OUTPUT "Please enter a valid choice"
ENDCASE

Activity 7.5
Use a CASE statement to display the day of the week if the variable DAY has a
whole number value between 1 and 7 inclusive and an error message otherwise.

The pseudocode for iteration
When some actions performed as part of an algorithm need repeating this is
called iteration. Loop structures are used to perform the iteration.

7.2 Computer systems, sub-systems and decomposition

Pseudocode includes these three different types of loop structure:
A set number of repetitions
A repetition, where the number of repeats is not
known, that is completed at least once:
A repetition, where the number of repeats is not
known, that may never be completed:

FOR … TO … NEXT
REPEAT … UNTIL
WHILE … DO …
ENDWHILE

All types of loops can all perform the same task, for example displaying ten
stars:
FOR Counter ← 1 TO 10
OUTPUT "*"

A FOR … NEXT
loop

NEXT Counter

Counter ← 0
REPEAT

A REPEAT …
UNTIL loop

OUTPUT "*"
Counter ← Counter + 1
UNTIL Counter > 9

Counter ← 0
WHILE Counter < 10 DO

A WHILE … DO …
ENDWHILE loop

OUTPUT "*"
Counter ← Counter + 1
ENDWHILE

As you can see, the FOR … TO … NEXT loop is the most efficient way for
a programmer to write this type of task as the loop counter is automatically
managed.

Link
For more on arrays
see Chapter 8.

FOR … TO … NEXT loops
A variable is set up, with a start value and an end value, this variable is
incremented in steps of one until the end value is reached and the iteration
finishes. The variable can be used within the loop so long as its value is not
changed. This type of loop is very useful for reading values into lists with a
known length.
FOR Counter ← 1 TO 10

Counter starts at 1 and
finishes at 10

REPEAT … UNTIL loop
This loop structure is used when the number of repetitions/iterations is not
known and the actions are repeated UNTIL a given condition becomes true. The
actions in this loop are always completed at least once. This is a post-condition
loop as the test for exiting the loop is at the end of the loop.
Total ← 0
Mark ← 0
REPEAT
Total ← Total + Mark

Variables
Total and
Mark are both
initialised to
zero.

OUTPUT "Enter value for mark, -1 to finish "
INPUT Mark
UNTIL Mark = -1

At least one
mark is entered.

WHILE … DO … ENDWHILE loop
This loop structure is used when the number of repetitions/iterations is not known
and the actions are only repeated WHILE a given condition is true. If the WHILE
condition is untrue then the actions in this loop are never performed. This is a
pre-condition loop as the test for exiting the loop is at the beginning of the loop.
Total ← 0
OUTPUT "Enter value for mark, -1 to finish "
INPUT Mark

Only the
variable Total
is initialised to
zero

WHILE Mark <> -1 DO
Total ← Total + Mark
OUTPUT "Enter value for mark, -1 to finish"
INPUT Mark

Condition
tested at start
of loop

ENDWHILE

The pseudocode for input and output statements
INPUT and OUTPUT are used for the entry of data and display of information.
Sometimes READ can be used instead of INPUT but this is usually used for
reading from files – see Chapter 8. Also, PRINT can be used instead of OUTPUT
if a hard copy is required.

INPUT is used for data entry; it is usually followed by a variable where the data
input is stored, for example:
INPUT Name
INPUT StudentMark

OUTPUT is used to display information either on a screen or printed on paper;
it is usually followed by a single value that is a string or a variable, or a list of
values separated by commas, for example:
OUTPUT Name
OUTPUT "Your name is ", Name
OUTPUT Name1, "Ali", Name3
