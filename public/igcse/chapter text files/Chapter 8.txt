Programming
In this chapter, you will learn about:
★ programming concepts:
– use of variables and constants
– input and output
– sequence
– selection including nesting
– iteration
– totalling and counting
– string handling
– operators – arithmetic, logical and Boolean
– procedures and functions including the use of:
– parameters
– local and global variables
– library routines
– creating a maintainable program
★ arrays: including one- and two-dimensional arrays, use of indexes, use of
iteration for reading from and writing to arrays
★ file handling: including opening, closing, reading from and writing to data and
text files.

The previous chapter enabled you to develop your computational thinking
by writing algorithms to perform various tasks. This chapter will show
you how to put your computational thinking to the ultimate test by writing
computer programs to perform tasks.

So far you have tested your algorithms by dry-running. Once you have written a
program for your algorithm, and when there are no syntax errors (see Chapter 4),
you will now use a computer to run the program to complete the task you have
specified. The computer will perform the task exactly as you have written it; you
may need to make some changes before it works exactly as you intend it to.
In Chapter 4 you learned that programs could be written in high- or low-level
languages then translated and run. This chapter will introduce you to the
programming concepts required for practical use of a high-level language. This
chapter shows the concepts behind such programming languages but should be
used in conjunction with learning the syntax of an appropriate programming
language.
There are many high-level programming languages to choose from. For IGCSE
Computer Science the high-level programming languages recommended are
Python, Visual Basic or Java. The use of one of these languages is also required
for A Level Computer Science.
Many programming languages need an interactive development environment
(IDE) to write and run code. IDEs are free to download and use.

Programs developed in this chapter will be illustrated using the following freely
available languages:
» Python a general purpose, open source programming language that promotes
rapid program development and readable code. The IDE used for screenshots in
this chapter is called IDLE.
» Visual Basic, a widely used programming language for Windows. The IDE
used for screenshots in this chapter is called Visual Studio.
» Java, a commercial language used by many developers. The IDE used for
screenshots in this chapter is called BlueJ.
The traditional introduction to programming in any language is to display the
words ‘Hello World’ on a computer screen. The programs look very different, but

Find out more about each of the three programming languages Python, Visual Basic
and Java. Decide, with the help of your teacher, which programming language will be
best to use for your IGCSE work.

Programming is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. In the next
sections of this chapter, after you have decided which programming language you
are going to use, you can just consider the examples for your chosen language.

8.1 Programming concepts
There are five basic constructs to use and understand when developing a program:
» data use – variables, constants and arrays
» sequence – order of steps in a task
» selection – choosing a path through a program
» iteration – repetition of a sequence of steps in a program
» operator use – arithmetic for calculations, logical and Boolean for decisions.

8.1.1 Variables and constants
In a program, any data used can have a fixed value that does not change while
the program is running.
A variable in a computer program is a named data store than contains a value
that may change during the execution of a program. In order to make programs
understandable to others, variables should be given meaningful names.
A constant in a computer program is a named data store than contains a value
that does not change during the execution of a program. As with variables,
302

318281_C08_CAM_IGCSE CO_SCI_299_338.indd 302

2/18/21 12:11 PM

8.1 Programming concepts

in order to make programs understandable to others, constants should also be
given meaningful names.
Not all programming languages explicitly differentiate between constants and
variables, but programmers should be clear which data stores can be changed and
which cannot be changed. There are several ways of highlighting a constant, for
example:
Use of capital letters

PI = 3.142

Meaningful names that begin with Const

ConstPi = 3.142

It is considered good practice to declare the constants and variables to be used in
that program. Some languages require explicit declarations, which specifically state
what type of data the variable or constant will hold. Other languages require implicit
declarations, where the data type is based on the value assigned. Declarations can
be at the start of a program or just before the data is used for the first time.
Here are some sample declaration statements in pseudocode and programming
code – just look at the sections for pseudocode and the programming language
you are using.
▼ Table 8.1 How to declare variables and constants
Declarations of constants and variables

Language

DECLARE FirstVar : INTEGER

Pseudocode declarations, variables
are explicit but constants are implicit.

DECLARE SecondVar : INTEGER
CONSTANT FirstConst ¨ 500
CONSTANT SecondConst ¨ 100
FirstVar = 20
SecondVar = 30
FIRSTCONST = 500
SECONDCONST = 100

Python does not require any separate
declarations and does not differentiate
between constants and variables.
Programmers need to keep track of and
manage these differences instead.

or
FirstVar, SecondVar = 20, 30
FirstConst, SecondConst = 500,100
Dim FirstVar As Integer
Dim SecondVar As Integer
Const FirstConst As Integer = 500
Const SecondConst As Integer = 500
or
Dim FirstVar, SecondVar As Integer
Const First, Second As Integer = 500,
100
int FirstVar;
int SecondVar;
final int FIRSTCONST = 500;
final int SECONDCONST = 100;

In Visual Basic variables are explicitly
declared as particular data types
before use. Declarations can be single
statements or multiple declarations in
a single statement. Constants can be
explicitly typed as shown or implicitly
typed, for example:
Const First = 500
... which implicitly defines the constant
as an integer.
In Java constant values are declared
as variables with a final value so no
changes can be made. These final
variable names are usually capitalised to
show they cannot be changed.
Variables are often declared as they are
used rather than at the start of the code.

8.1.2 Basic data types
In order for a computer system to process and store data effectively, different
kinds of data are formally given different types. This enables:
» data to be stored in an appropriate way, for example, as numbers or as characters
» data to be manipulated effectively, for example, numbers with mathematical
operators and characters with concatenation
» automatic validation in some cases.
The basic data types you will need to use for IGCSE Computer Science are:
» integer – a positive or negative whole number that can be used with
mathematical operators
» real – a positive or negative number with a fractional part. Real numbers can
be used with mathematical operators
» char – a variable or constant that is a single character
» string – a variable or constant that is several characters in length. Strings
vary in length and may even have no characters (known as an empty string);
the characters can be letters and/or digits and/or any other printable symbol
(If a number is stored as a string then it cannot be used in calculations.)
» Boolean – a variable or constant that can have only two values TRUE or FALSE.

Activity 8.2
In pseudocode and the high-level programming language that your school has
chosen to use, declare the variables and constants you would use in an algorithm
to find the volume of a cylinder.

8.1.3 Input and output
In order to be able to enter data and output results, programs need to use input
and output statements. For IGCSE Computer Science you need to be able to write
algorithms and programs that take input from a keyboard and output to a screen.
For a program to be useful, the user needs to know what they are expected to input,
so each input needs to be accompanied by a prompt stating the input required.
Here are examples of inputs in programming code – pseudocode was considered in
Chapter 7. Just look at the section for the programming language you are using.
304

318281_C08_CAM_IGCSE CO_SCI_299_338.indd 304

2/18/21 12:11 PM

8.1 Programming concepts

In a programming language the data type of the input must match the required
data type of the variable where the input data is to be stored. All inputs default
as strings, so if the input should be an integer or real number, commands are
also used to change the data type of the input (for instance, in Python these are
int() or float()).
▼ Table 8.3 Examples of input statements with prompts

Find out more
These input
statements use
a programming
technique called
casting, which
converts variables
from one data type
to another. Find
out more about the
use of casting in
the programming
language that you
have decided to use.

Input statements

Language

radius = float(input("Please enter the
radius of the cylinder "))

Python combines the prompt with the
input statement.

Console.Write("Please enter the radius
of the cylinder ")

Visual Basic uses a separate prompt and
input. The input specifies the type of
data expected.

radius = Decimal.Parse(Console.
ReadLine())
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Please enter the
radius of the cylinder ");
double radius = myObj.nextDouble();

In Java the input library has to be
imported at the start of the program
and an input object is set up. Java uses
a separate prompt and input. The input
specifies the type and declares the
variable of the same type.

Activity 8.2a
In the high-level programming language that your school has chosen to use, write
expressions that would store user inputs as the data types represented by the
following:
» 12
» 12.00
» X
» X marks the spot
» TRUE.

For a program to be useful, the user needs to know what results are being
output, so each output needs to be accompanied by a message explaining
the result. If there are several parts to an output statement, then each part is
separated by a separator character.
Here are examples of outputs in programming code – pseudocode was considered
in Chapter 7. Just look at the section for the programming language you are
using.
▼ Table 8.4 Examples of output statements with messages

Language

print("Volume of the cylinder is ", volume)

8.1.4 Basic concepts
When writing the steps required to solve a problem, the following concepts need
to be used and understood:
» sequence
» selection
» iteration
» counting and totalling
» string handling
» use of operators.

8.1.4(a) Sequence
The ordering of the steps in an algorithm is very important. An incorrect order
can lead to incorrect results and/or extra steps that are not required by the task.

Worked example
For example, the following pseudocode algorithm uses a REPEAT...UNTIL loop to
calculate and output total marks, average marks and the number of marks entered.
DECLARE, Total, Average : REAL
DECLARE Mark, Counter : INTEGER
Total ← 0
Mark ← 0
Counter ← 0
OUTPUT "Enter marks, 999 to finish "
REPEAT
INPUT Mark
Total ← Total + Mark
IF Mark = 999
THEN
Average ← Total / Counter
ENDIF
Counter ← Counter + 1
UNTIL Mark = 999
OUTPUT "The total mark is ", Total
OUTPUT "The average mark is ", Average
OUTPUT "The number of marks is ", Counter
A trace table is completed using this test data:

8.1.4(b) Selection
Selection is a very useful technique, allowing different routes through the steps
of a program. For example, data items can be picked out according to given
criteria, such as: selecting the largest value or smallest value, selecting items
over a certain price, selecting everyone who is male.
Selection was demonstrated in pseudocode with the use of IF and CASE
statements in Chapter 7.

8.1.4(c) Iteration
As stated in Chapter 7, there are three types of loop structures available to
perform iterations so that a section of programming code can be repeated under
certain conditions.
These are:
» Count-controlled loops (for a set number of iterations)
» Pre-condition loops – may have no iterations
» Post-condition loops – always has at least one iteration.

that your school has chosen to use.

Count-controlled loops
FOR loops are used when a set number of iterations are required. Look at some of
the different types of FOR statements with a counter starting at one, finishing
at ten and increments by two for every iteration.
▼ Table 8.10 FOR loops
For statement examples

Language

for Counter in range (1,11,2):

Python uses the range function, a colon
to show the start of the for loop and
indentation of all statements in the for
loop.

print(Counter)
For Counter = 1 To 10 Step 2

Visual Basic uses Step and Next

Console.WriteLine(Counter)
Next
for (int Counter = 1; Counter <= 10;
Counter = Counter + 2)

Java uses {} to show the start and end of the
for loop.

{
System.out.println(Counter);
}

Condition-controlled loops
When the number of iterations is not known, there are two options:
» pre-condition loops which may have no iterations
» post-condition loops which always have at least one iteration.
Look at some of the different pre- and post-condition loops used in your
programming language.

Python uses a colon to show the start of
the while loop and indentation to show
which statements are in the while loop.

TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight
While TotalWeight < 100

Visual Basic uses While and End While

TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight
End While
while (TotalWeight < 100)
{

Java uses {} to show the start and end of
the while loop.

TotalWeight = TotalWeight + Weight;
}

Loop Until NumberOfItems > 19
Do

Java uses do and while so the condition is
the opposite of the until condition used
in Visual Basic. Look at the code carefully to
see the difference. Java uses {} to show the
start and end of the loop.

{
NumberOfItems ++;
}
while (NumberOfItems <= 20);

Activity 8.6
In the high-level programming language that your school has chosen to use, write
and run two short programs, one using a count-controlled loop and the other a
condition-controlled loop. They should each repeat ten times, incrementing the
loop counter by three and outputting the value for each iteration.

8.1.4(d) Totalling and counting
Totalling and counting were introduced in Chapter 7 as standard methods. Take a
look at how these methods are implemented in your programming language.
Totalling is very similar in all three languages.

8.1.4(e) String Handling
Strings are used to store text. Every string contains a number of characters, from
an empty string, which has no characters stored, to a maximum number specified
by the programming language. The characters in a string can be labelled by
position number. The first character in a string can be in position zero or
position one, depending on the language.
Find out more
Find the maximum number of characters that the high-level programming language
that your school has chosen can store in a string.
Find out the position number of the first character defined by this programming
language.

String handling is an important part of programming. As an IGCSE Computer
Science student, you will need to write algorithms and programs for these
methods:
» length – finding the number of characters in the string. For example, the
length of the string "Computer Science" is 16 characters as spaces are
counted as a character.
» substring – extracting part of a string. For example, the substring
"Science" could be extracted from "Computer Science".
» upper – converting all the letters in a string to uppercase. For example, the
string "Computer Science" would become "COMPUTER SCIENCE".
» lower – converting all the letters in a string to lowercase. For example, the
string "Computer Science" would become "computer science".
These string manipulation methods are usually provided in programming
languages by library routines, see later in this chapter for further use of library
routines.
Most programming languages support many different string handling methods.

8.1.5 Use of nested statements
Selection and iteration statements can be nested one inside the other. This
powerful method reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and makes
it simpler for a programmer to test their programs.
One type of construct can be nested within another – for example, selection can
be nested within a condition-controlled loop, or one loop can be nested within
another loop.

Have a look at the pseudocode, start with the inner loop for the number of tests.

Activity 8.11
In the high-level programming language that your school has chosen to use, use
the pseudocode solution to help you to write and test a short program to calculate
and output largest, highest, lowest and average marks for a single subject with
five tests taken by a student.
Hints:
» Look at the other statements and output needed as well as the loop.
» For testing purposes, you can reduce the number of tests to two or three.

Now look at the middle loop that surrounds the inner loop for the number of
students.

Activity 8.12
When the single subject program is working, extend it to calculate and output
largest, highest, lowest, and average marks for a single student with six subjects
studied by a student.
Hints:

» Look at the other statements and outputs needed as well as the loop.
» For testing purposes reduce the number of subjects to two or three.

Finally look at the whole program that includes the outer loop for the whole class.

Activity 8.13
When the single student program is working, extend your program to complete
the task to calculate and output the largest, highest, lowest, and average marks
for the whole class of 20 students.
Hint:

» For testing purposes reduce the class size to two or three.

8.1.6 Procedures and functions
When writing an algorithm, there are often similar tasks to perform that make
use of the same groups of statements. Instead of repeating these statements
and writing new code every time they are required, many programming languages
make use of subroutines, also known as named procedures or functions. These
are defined once and can be called many times within a program.

Procedures, functions and parameters
A procedure is a set of programming statements grouped together under a single
name that can be called to perform a task at any point in a program.
A function is a set of programming statements grouped together under a single
name that can be called to perform a task at any point in a program. In contrast
to a procedure, a function will return a value back to the main program.
Parameters are the variables that store the values of the arguments passed to
a procedure or function. Some but not all procedures and functions will have
parameters.

Definition and use of procedures and functions, with or without
parameters
Procedures without parameters
Here is an example of a procedure without parameters in pseudocode:
PROCEDURE Stars
OUTPUT"************"
ENDPROCEDURE

The procedure can then be called in the main part of the program as many times
as is required in the following way:
CALL Stars

Instead of calling them procedures, different terminology is used by each
programming language. Procedures are known as:
» void functions in Python
» subroutines in VB
» methods in Java.

Language

def Stars():

Python

Visual Basic

Java

print("************")
Sub Stars()
Console.WriteLine("************")
End Sub
static void Stars()
{
System.out.println("***********");
}

Activity 8.14
Write a short program in your chosen programming language to define and use a
procedure to display three lines of stars.

It is often useful to pass a value to a procedure that can be used to modify the
action(s) taken. For example, to decide how many stars would be output. This
is done by passing an argument when the procedure is called to be used as a
parameter by the procedure.
Procedures with parameters
Here is an example of how a procedure with parameters can be defined in
pseudocode.

318281_C08_CAM_IGCSE CO_SCI_299_338.indd 322

2/18/21 12:11 PM

8.1 Programming concepts

We can add parameters to a procedure:
PROCEDURE Stars (Number : INTEGER)

Parameter with
data type

DECLARE Counter : INTEGER
FOR Counter ← 1 TO NUMBER
OUTPUT "*"
NEXT Counter
ENDPROCEDURE

Procedure with parameters are called like this – in this case to print seven stars:
CALL Stars (7)

Or:
MyNumber ← 7
CALL stars (MyNumber)

A procedure call must match the procedure definition. This means that when a
procedure is defined with parameters, the arguments in the procedure call should
match the parameters in the procedure definition. For IGCSE Computer Science
the number of parameters used is limited to two.

{

}

Activity 8.15
Extend your short program in your chosen programming language to define and
use a procedure that accepts a parameter to write a given number of lines of
stars. You will find the following commands useful:
» \n in Python
» Writeline in Visual Basic
» Println in Java.

Functions
A function is just like a procedure except it always returns a value. Just
like a procedure it is defined once and can be called many times within
a program. Just like a procedure it can be defined with or without
parameters.
Unlike procedures, function calls are not standalone and instead can be made on
the right-hand side of an expression.
Instead of naming them functions, different terminology is used by some
programming languages. Functions are known as:
» fruitful functions in Python
» functions in VB
» methods with returns in Java.
The keyword RETURN is used as one of the statements in a function to specify
the value to be returned. This is usually the last statement in the function
definition.
For example, here is a function written in pseudocode to convert a temperature
from Fahrenheit to Celsius:
Parameter and
function return both
have defined data
types.

FUNCTION Celsius (Temperature : REAL) RETURNS REAL
RETURN (Temperature – 32) / 1.8
ENDFUNCTION

Because a function returns a value, it can be called by assigning the return value
directly into a variable as follows:
MyTemp ← Celsius(MyTemp)

324

Function temperature conversion example

Language

def Celsius(Temperature):

Python – data type of function does
not need to be defined

Function Celsius(ByVal Temperature As Decimal) As Decimal

Visual Basic

Return (Temperature - 32) / 1.8
End Function
static double Celsius(double Temperature)

Java

{
return (Temperature - 32) / 1.8;
}

Just like with a procedure, a function call must match the function definition.
When a function is defined with parameters, the arguments in the function call
should match the parameters in the procedure definition. For IGCSE Computer
Science the number of parameters used is limited to two.

Activity 8.16
Write an algorithm in pseudocode as a function, with a parameter, to convert
a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Test your algorithm by writing a
short program in your chosen programming language to define and use this
function.

When procedures and functions are defined, the first statement in the definition
is a header, which contains:
» the name of the procedure or function
» any parameters passed to the procedure or function, and their data type
» the data type of the return value for a function.
Procedure calls are single standalone statements. Function calls are made as part
of an expression, on the right-hand side.

Local and global variables
A global variable can be used by any part of a program – its scope covers the
whole program.
A local variable can only be used by the part of the program it has been
declared in – its scope is restricted to that part of the program.
For example, in this algorithm the variables Number1, Number2 and Answer
are declared both locally and globally, whereas Number3 is only declared
locally.

The final line is an error because the main program has tried to access the
variable Number3, which is local to the procedure.

Advice
As well as library
routines, typical IDEs
also contain an editor,
for entering code, and
an interpreter and/or
a compiler, to run the
code.

8.1.7 Library routines
Many programming language development systems include library routines that
are ready to incorporate into a program. These routines are fully tested and
ready for use. A programming language IDE usually includes a standard library of
functions and procedures. These standard library routines perform many types of
task – such as the string handling discussed in Section 8.1.4.
Each programming language has many library routines for standard tasks that
are commonly required by programs. Sometimes a set of routines needs to be
specifically identified in a program. For example, in Java, the statement import
java.lang.String; is required at the start of a program to provide access to
the string handling library.
You will need to use these library routines in your programs for IGCSE Computer
Science:
» MOD – returns remainder of a division
» DIV – returns the quotient (i.e. the whole number part) of a division
» ROUND – returns a value rounded to a given number of decimal places
» RANDOM – returns a random number.
Here are some examples of these library routines in pseudocode:
Value1 ¨ MOD(10,3) returns the remainder of 10 divided by 3
Value2 ¨ DIV(10,3) returns the quotient of 10 divided by 3
Value3 ¨ ROUND(6.97354, 2) returns the value rounded to 2 decimal places
Value4 ¨ RANDOM() returns a random number between 0 and 1 inclusive

Activity 8.19
Identify the values of the variables Value1, Value2 and Value3.

318281_C08_CAM_IGCSE CO_SCI_299_338.indd 327

8 Programming

Here are the same examples, written in each programming language:
▼ Table 8.25  MOD, DIV, ROUND and RANDOM programming examples
Programming examples for MOD, DIV, ROUND and
RANDOM

Language

Value1 = 10%3

Python – MOD uses the % operator and DIV the //
operator

Value2 = 10//3
Value = divmod(10,3)
Value3 = round(6.97354, 2)
from random import random

The function divmod(x,y) provides both answers where
the first answer is DIV and the second answer is MOD
RANDOM needs to import the library routine random, and
then the function: random() can be used afterwards

Value4 = random()
Value1 = 10 Mod 3

Visual Basic – DIV uses the \ operator

Value2 = 10 \ 3
Value3 = Math.Round(6.97354, 2)
Value4 = Rnd()
import java.lang.Math;

Java – MOD uses the % operator

Value1 = 10%3;

DIV uses the normal division operator; if the numbers
being divided are both integers then integer division is
performed, as shown.

Value2 = 10/3;
Value3 = Math.round(6.97354 * 100)/100.0;
import java.util.Random;
Random rand = new Random();

Java imports the library routine Math
Math.round only rounds to whole numbers
RANDOM needs to import the library routine Random

double Value4 = rand.nextDouble();

Advice
A program written
for a real task should
be understandable to
another programmer.
Program code in a
structured questions
may not always follow
these rules, to test
your ability to trace
the steps in a routine
or correct some
errors.

Activity 8.20
Write and test a short program in your chosen programming language to:
» input two integers a and b and then find a MOD b and a DIV b
» create a random integer between 100 and 300.

8.1.8 Creating a maintainable program
Once a program is written, it may need to be maintained or updated by another
programmer at a later date. The programmer may have no documentation other
than a copy of the source program. Even a programmer looking at their own
program several years later may have forgotten exactly how all the tasks in it
were completed!
A maintainable program should:
» always use meaningful identifier names for:
– variables
– constants
– arrays
– procedures
– functions

and
/* to start multiple line comments
and to end them
*/

Activity 8.21
Check your last two programs and make sure they could be maintained by another
programmer. Swap your program listing with another student and check that they
can understand it.

8.2 Arrays
An array is a data structure containing several elements of the same data type;
these elements can be accessed using the same identifier name. The position of
each element in an array is identified using the array’s index.

8.2.1 One- and Two-dimensional arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple data items in a uniformly accessible manner;
all the data items use the same identifier and each data item can be accessed
separately by the use of an index. In this way, lists of items can be stored,
searched and put into an order. For example, a list of names can be ordered
alphabetically, or a list of temperatures can be searched to find a particular
value.
The first element of an array can have an index of zero or one. However, most
programming languages automatically set the first index of an array to zero.
Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. One-dimensional and
two-dimensional arrays are included the IGCSE Computer Science syllabus.

8.2.2 Declaring and populating arrays with iteration
One-dimensional arrays
A one-dimensional array can be referred to as a list. Here is an example of a list
with 10 elements in it where the first element has an index of zero.

When a one-dimensional array is declared in pseudocode:
» the name of the array
» the first index value
» the last index value
» and the data type
are included.
For example, to declare a new array called MyList:
DECLARE MyList : ARRAY[0:9] OF INTEGER

Each position in the array can be populated in an array by defining the value
at each index position. For instance, we can add the number 27 to the fourth
position in the array MyList as follows:
MyList[4] ← 27

To populate the entire array instead we can use a loop:
OUTPUT "Enter these 10 values in order 27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72"
FOR Counter ← 0 TO 9
OUTPUT "Enter next value "
INPUT MyList[Counter]
NEXT Counter

Notice that in this code we have used the variable Counter as the array index.
We can display the data that lies in a particular location in an array as follows:
OUTPUT MyList[1]

This would display the value 19.

8.2 Arrays

Activity 8.22
In your chosen programming language write a short program to declare and
populate the array MyList, as shown in Figure 8.10, using a FOR loop.

Arrays can also be populated as they are declared.
▼ Table 8.27 Array population

Language

myList = [27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72]

Python

Dim myList = New Integer() {27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72}

Visual Basic

int[] myList = {27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72};

Java

Two-dimensional arrays
A two-dimensional array can be referred to as a table, with rows and columns.
Here is an example of a table with 10 rows and 3 columns, which contains 30
elements. The first element is located at position 0,0.

When a two-dimensional array is declared in pseudocode:
» the first index value for rows
» the last index value for rows
» the first index value for columns
» the last index value for columns
» and the data type
are included.
For example:
DECLARE MyTable : ARRAY[0:9,0:2] OF INTEGER

The declared array can then be populated using a loop, just like for onedimensional arrays – however this time there need to be two nested loops, one
for each index:
OUTPUT "Enter these values in order 27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 34"
OUTPUT "Enter these values in order 31, 67, 98, 22, 35, 46, 71, 23, 11, 76"
OUTPUT "Enter these values in order 17, 48, 29, 95, 61, 47, 28, 13, 77, 21"
FOR ColumnCounter ← 0 TO 2
FOR RowCounter ← 0 TO 9
OUTPUT "Enter next value "
INPUT MyTable[RowCounter, ColumnCounter]
NEXT RowCounter
NEXT ColumnCounter

We can display the data that lies in a particular location in a two-dimensional
array as follows:
OUTPUT MyList[2,1]

This would display the value 98.

Advice
Notes on Python and arrays
Instead of arrays, Python uses another object called a list. The differences you
need to know are:
» a list can contain different data types whereas arrays must all hold the same
type of data
» to achieve the same structure as a two-dimensional array, Python embeds lists
within another.

Two-dimensional arrays are populated in each language as follows:

8.3 File handling

Activity 8.23
In your chosen programming language, write a program to declare and populate
the array MyTable, as shown in Figure 8.11, using a nested FOR loop.

8.3 File handling
8.3.1 Purpose of storing data in a file
Computer programs store data that will be required again in a file. While any
data stored in RAM will be lost when the computer is switched off, when data is
saved to a file it is stored permanently. Data stored in a file can thus be accessed
by the same program at a later date or accessed by another program. Data stored
in a file can also be sent to be used on other computer(s). The storage of data in
files is one of the most used features of programming.

8.3.2 Using files
Every file is identified by its filename. In this section, we are going to look at
how to read and write a line of text or a single item of data to a file.
Here are examples of writing a line of text to a file and reading the line of text
back from the file. The pseudocode algorithm has comments to explain each
stage of the task.

pseudocode
DECLARE TextLine : STRING

// variables are declared as normal

DECLARE MyFile : STRING
MyFile ← "MyText.txt"
// writing the line of text to the file
OPEN MyFile FOR WRITE

// opens file for writing

OUTPUT "Please enter a line of text"
INPUT TextLine
WRITEFILE, TextLine
CLOSEFILE(MyFile)

// writes a line of text to the file

// closes the file

// reading the line of text from the file
OUTPUT "The file contains this line of text:"
OPEN MyFile FOR READ
READFILE, TextLine

// opens file for reading
// reads a line of text from the file

OUTPUT TextLine
CLOSEFILE(MyFile)

// closes the file

Cambridge O Level Computer Science (0478) Paper 21 Q5, June 2017

For IGCSE Computer Science, you should be able to write an understandable
algorithm to solve a problem. Your algorithm should be easy to read and
understand and may use any of the concepts in this chapter and Chapter 7.
Here are some further problems for you to solve:
10 The one-dimensional array StaffName[] contains the names of the staff
in a department. Another one-dimensional array StaffPhone[] contains
the phone numbers for the members of staff. A final one-dimensional array
StaffOffice[] contains the office location for the members of staff.
The position of each member of staff’s data in the three arrays is the same,
for example, the member of staff in position 5 in StaffPhone[] and
StaffOffice[] is the same.
Write a program that meets the following requirements:
» uses procedures to display these lists:
– staff phone numbers and names in alphabetic order of staff name
– members of staff grouped by office number
» uses a procedure to display all the details for a member of staff, with the
name used as a parameter
» uses a procedure to update the details for a member of staff, with the
name used as a parameter.
You must use program code with local and global variables and add
comments to explain how your code works.
[15]
11 Use a trace table to test the program you have written in question 10.
[If you have used a real programming language to write your program then
it is also good practice to run the program to test and help find errors.][5]
12 You can become a member of the town guild if you meet all the following
requirements:
» aged between 18 and 65
» you have lived in the town for 20 years
or you have lived in the town for 5 years and both your parents still live in
the town
or one parent has died and the other parent still lives in the town
or you and a brother or a sister have lived in the town for 10 years
» you have half a million dollars in your bank account
» you have never been to prison
» at least two guild members support your application
» if five guild members support your application then you could be excused
one of the above requirements, apart from age
Write a program that allows you to input answers to questions to ensure that
you meet the requirements, issues a unique membership number if you do or
explains all the reasons for failure if you don’t meet the requirements.
