3.4 Network hardware
3.4.1 Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card (NIC) is needed to allow a device to connect to
a network (such as the internet). It is usually part of the device hardware
and contains the Media Access Control (MAC) address generated at the
manufacturing stage.
Wireless network interface cards/controllers (WNICs) are the same as NICs in that
they are used to connect devices to the internet or other networks. However,
they use wireless connectivity utilising an antenna to communicate with
networks via microwaves. They would normally plug into the USB port or be part
of an internal integrated circuit.

3.4.2 Media Access Control (MAC)
A MAC address is made up of 48 bits which are shown as six groups of
hexadecimal digits with the general format:
NN – NN – NN – DD – DD – DD
manufacturer’s         device serial
           code
            number

For example, 00 – 1C – B3 – 4F – 25 – FF where the first six hex digits identify
the device as made by, for example, Apple and the second set of six hex digits
are the serial number of the device itself (this is unique). If the NIC card is
replaced, the MAC address will also change.

Types of MAC address
It should finally be pointed out that there are two types of MAC address: the
Universally Administered MAC Address (UAA) and the Locally Administered
MAC Address (LAA).
The UAA is by far the most common type of MAC address and this is the one set
by the manufacturer at the factory. It is rare for a user to want to change this
MAC address.
However, there are some occasions when a user or organisation wishes to change
their MAC address. This is a relatively easy task to carry out, but it will cause big
problems if the changed address isn’t unique.
There are a few reasons why the MAC address needs to be changed using LAA:
» certain software used on mainframe systems need all the MAC addresses of
devices to fall into a strict format; because of this, it may be necessary to
change the MAC address of some devices to ensure they follow the correct
format
» it may be necessary to bypass a MAC address filter on a router or a firewall;
only MAC addresses with a certain format are allowed through, otherwise the
devices will be blocked if their MAC address doesn’t adhere to the correct
format
» to get past certain types of network restrictions it may be necessary to
emulate unrestricted MAC addresses; hence it may require the MAC address to
be changed on certain devices connected to the network.

3.4.3 Internet protocol (IP) address
When a device connects to a private network, a router assigns a private IP
address to it. That IP address is unique on that network, but might be the same
as an IP address on a separate network. However, when a router connects to
the internet it is given a unique public IP address. This is usually supplied by
the internet service provider (ISP). No other device on the internet has the
same public IP address. All the devices connected to that router have the same
public IP address as the router but each have their own different private IP
addresses on that network. Because the operation of the internet is based on a
set of protocols (rules), it is necessary to supply an IP address. Protocols define
the rules that must be agreed by senders and receivers of data communicating
through the internet.
There are two versions of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is based on 32 bits and the
address is written as four groups of eight bits (shown in denary format); for
example,
254.25.28.77

Because the use of only 32 bits considerably reduces the potential number of
devices and routers used on the internet at any one time, a newer version called
IPv6 is now used. This uses 128-bit addresses that take the form of eight groups
of hex digits; for example,
A8FB:7A88:FFF0:0FFF:3D21:2085:66FB:F0FA

Link
For more on packet
routes see
Section 2.1.1.

Note the use of colons (:) and hexadecimal numbering. IPv6 has been designed to
allow the internet to grow in terms of the number of hosts and potential increase
in the amount of data traffic. The main advantages of IPv6 compared to IPv4 are:
» removes the risk of IP address collisions
» has built-in authentication checks
» allows for more efficient packet routes.

Static and dynamic IP addresses
IP addresses can be either static (don’t change) or dynamic (change every time a
device connects to the internet).
Static
Static IP addresses are permanently assigned to a device by the internet service
provider (ISP); they don’t change each time a device logs onto the internet.
Static IP addresses are usually assigned to:

» remote servers which are hosting a website
» an online database
» a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. FTP servers are used when files need to
be transferred to various computers throughout the network.
Dynamic
Dynamic IP addresses are assigned by the ISP each time a device logs onto the
internet. This is done using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). A
computer on the internet, configured as a DHCP server, is used by the ISP to
automatically assign an IP address to a device. As the name suggests, a dynamic
IP address could be different every time a device connects to the internet.

Table 3.14 compares static and dynamic IP addresses:
▼ Table 3.14 Dynamic and static IP addresses
Dynamic IP addresses

Static IP addresses

greater privacy since they change each time
a user logs on

since static IP addresses don’t change, they
allow each device to be fully traceable

dynamic IP addresses can be an issue
when using, for example, VoIP since this
type of addressing is less reliable as it
can disconnect and change the IP address
causing the VoIP connection to fail

allow for faster upload and download speeds
(see Figure 3.71)
more expensive to maintain since the
device must be constantly running so that
information is always available

Figure 3.71 shows the sequence of events when either a dynamic IP address or
static IP address is assigned to a device using the internet. The diagram shows
how a device contacts web servers that are also connected to the internet. A
DHCP server supplies a dynamic IP address to the device, a DNS server looks up
the domain name of the desired website into an IP address and a website server
contains the web pages of the desired website.

3.4.4 Routers
Routers enable data packets to be routed between different networks, for
example, to join a LAN to a WAN. The router takes data transmitted in one format
from a network (which is using a particular protocol) and converts the data to a
protocol and format understood by another network, thereby allowing them to
communicate. A router would typically have an internet cable plugged into it and
several cables connecting to computers and other devices on the LAN.

Broadband routers sit behind a firewall. The firewall protects the computers on
a network. The router’s main function is to transmit internet and transmission
protocols between two networks and also allow private networks to be connected
together.
Routers inspect the data package sent to it from any computer on any of the
networks connected to it. Since every computer on the same network has the
same part of an internet protocol (IP) address, the router is able to send the
data packet to the appropriate switch, and the data will then be delivered to
the correct device using the MAC destination address. If the MAC address doesn’t
match any device connected to the switch, it passes on to another switch on
the same network until the appropriate device is found. Routers can be wired or
wireless devices.

Extension
For those students considering the study of this
subject at A Level, the following section gives some
insight into further study of computer hardware and
wireless networks.

Topic 1: Computer ports
Input and output devices are connected to a computer
via ports. The interaction of the ports with connected
input and output is controlled by the control unit.
Here we will summarise some of the more common
types of ports found on modern computers:
USB ports
The Universal Serial
Bus (USB) is an
asynchronous serial
data transmission
method. It has quickly
become the standard
method for transferring
data between a computer
and a number of devices.
Essentially, the USB
cable consists of:

» a 4-wired shielded cable
» 2 of the wires are used for power and the earth
» 2 of the wires are used in the data transmission.
When a device is plugged into a computer, using one
of the USB ports, the computer:
» automatically detects that a device is present (this
is due to a small change in the voltage level on the
data signal wires in the cable)
» the device is automatically recognised, and the
appropriate device driver is loaded up so that
computer and device can communicate effectively
» if a new device is detected, the computer will look
for the device driver which matches the device;
if this is not available, the user is prompted to
download the appropriate software.
Even though the USB system has become the
industrial standard, there are still a number of
benefits ( ) and drawbacks (X) to using this system:

X
devices plugged into the computer are automatically
detected; device drivers are automatically loaded up

the present transmission rate is limited to less than 500
megabits per second

the connectors can only fit one way; this prevents incorrect the maximum cable length is presently about 5 metres
connections being made
USB has become the industry standard; this means that
considerable support is available to users

the older USB standard (1.1) may not still be supported in
the near future

several different data transmission rates are supported
newer USB standards are backward compatible with older
USB standards

High-definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)
High-definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ports
allow output (both audio and visual) from a computer
to an HDMI-enabled monitor or other device. It
will support high definition signals (enhanced
or standard). HDMI was introduced as a digital
replacement for the older VGA analogue system.
Modern HD (high definition) televisions have the
following features which are making VGA a redundant
technology:
» they use a widescreen format (16:9 aspect ratio)
» the screens use a greater number of pixels
(typically 1920 ×1080)
» the screens have a faster refresh rate (e.g. 120 Hz
or 120 frames a second)

» the range of colours is extremely large (some
companies claim up to 4 million different colour
variations!).

This all means that modern HD televisions require
more data and this data has to be received at a much
faster rate than with older televisions (e.g. 10 gigabits
per second). HDMI increases the bandwidth making it
possible to supply the necessary data to produce high
quality sound and visual effects.

Topic 2: Wired and wireless networks
Wireless
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth offer wireless
communication between devices. They both use
electromagnetic radiation as the carrier of data
transmission.
Bluetooth sends and receives radio waves in a band of
79 different frequencies (known as channels). These
are all centred on a 2.45 GHz frequency. Devices using
Bluetooth automatically detect and connect to each
other; but they don’t interfere with other devices since
each communicating pair uses a different channel
(from the 79 options).
When a device wants to communicate, it picks one of
the 79 channels at random. If the channel is already
being used, it randomly picks another channel. This
is known as spread-spectrum frequency hopping. To
further minimise the risks of interference with other
devices, the communication pairs constantly
change the frequencies (channels) they are using

(several times a second). Bluetooth creates a secure
wireless personal area network (WPAN) based on key
encryption.
Essentially, Bluetooth is useful:
» when transferring data between two or more
devices which are very close together (< 30 metres
distance)
» when the speed of data transmission is not critical
» for low bandwidth applications (e.g. when sending
music files from a mobile phone to a headset).
Wi-Fi is best suited to operating full-scale networks
since it offers much faster data transfer rates, better
range and better security than Bluetooth. A Wi-Fienabled device (such as a computer or smartphone)
can access the internet wirelessly at any wireless
access point (WAP) or ‘hot spot’ up to 100 metres
away.
As mentioned above, wireless connectivity uses
electromagnetic radiation: radio waves, microwaves
or infrared. The scale of frequency and wavelength of
magnetic radiation can be seen in the table below:
