                    Topic 7 taught you how to <em>design</em> algorithms; Topic 8 is about <em>building</em> them.
                    This chapter covers the practical skills needed to write, test, and refine working computer
                    programs.
                    You will learn to control data flow with loops and logic, organise code with <span class="keyword" data-def="a set of programming statements grouped together under a single name which can be called to perform a task in a program, rather than including a copy of the code every time; just like a procedure except a function will return a value back to the main program">functions</span> and
