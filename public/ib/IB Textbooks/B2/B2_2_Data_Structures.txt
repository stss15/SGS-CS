B2.2.1 Static vs dynamic data structures
A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data, so it allows for its manipulation in
an efficient way and attempts to reduce the time and space complexity. Arrays, lists, stacks,

queues, binary trees and hash tables are all examples of data structures. Data structures can be

static or dynamic, the two differing in terms of storage and access to their elements.
A static data structure has a predefined fixed size, a specific memory space being allocated to
it, that will not change when running the program, and elements that are stored in contiguous

memory locations. Elements in a static data structure can be either directly accessed or
sequentially accessed.

B2.2.2 Arrays and lists
Hl One-dimensional arrays (Java) and one-dimensional lists
(Python)
Suppose your teacher wants to store the grades of 100 students. One way to complete this task
is to use 100 variables, but this means lots of memory waste, many lines of code and a lot of
effort. And what if this teacher needs to store 1000 grades?
A better solution is to store all those 100 or 1000 elements under a single name or a single
identifier. The array data structure allows you to do this.
A 1D array (Java) or a 1D list (Python) is a data structure that stores elements of the same data
type, under one single identifier (name). Those elements can be directly accessed by using
an index (plural indices), where the index indicates the position in the array. Some languages
indicate the first index as being the 0 element, and others allow the programmer to indicate

how the items will be addressed.
Tor example, an array of five integers storing students’ grades out of 100 is called grades.
Graphically, arrays can be represented horizontally or vertically.
index (position in array): lower limit: 0, upper limit: 4

ol (1] [21 3] [4)

grades |75|64|95|50|34

array size: 5

64|[1]

grades |95 |[2]
50|[3]
grades[2] = 95

34|[4]

W 1D array (list)

The array element at index 2 (the 3rd element, when counting from 0) can be directly accessed

by using the name of the array followed by the index: grades [2] . Keep in mind that, if the
first element has index 0, the last element is at index 4 (in this case, the grades array has only
five items).

To process arrays, loops are used. Loops can be used to traverse the array; therefore, any time
you perform calculations on all elements of an array, find an element, sort them, and so on,
you will use loops.

One-dimensional arrays (Java)
Array declaration and initialization:
To use arrays in Java, they must be declared, and the language allows for different ways to do
this. First, square brackets [] are used to differentiate between a variable and an array. They

B2.2 Data structures

can appear before or after the array name:
int grades
int

[]; //an array called grades of integers

[] grades; //grades array of integers

i

After deciding where you want to place the square brackets (most often, the first example is
used), you need to specify the size of the array, as it is a static data structure.

Declaration:
int grades([]l=new int[5];

i

//grades array can store maximum 5

//elements

:

If the array is of integer or double or float type, and there is no further initialization of the
array elements, Java automatically initializes all its elements to 0.
Initialization:

{ grades[0]=75;
grades[1]=64;
i

grades[2]=95;

! grades[3]1=50;
¢ grades[4]=34;

At this point, the elements of the array are given specific values, the value 0 being overwritten.
Another way to declare and initialize the array is like this:
int grades[]= new int[]{75,64,95,50,34};

But this can also be rewritten in a simpler way, like this:
Ye
T
TPP

T prr. wes

int grades[]={75,64,95,50,34};

Sometimes, the developer will have to allow the user to initialize the array. In such cases, you
can simply declare the array and use a loop to allow the user to populate the array.
read = new Scanner (System.in) ;
int grades[]=new int[5];

for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
:

!

{

System.out.println("Enter a number:

");

:

int value = read.nextInt();
grades [i] =value;

The loop repeats five times, and it requires the user to enter an integer value that will be stored
into the array indicated by index i (from 0 to 4).

B2 Programming

1f the array is of type string, it would look like this:
String pilots[]=

{"Bob",

Boolean passedExam[ ]

"John",

= {true,

T T T Ty B

"Elvis"};

false,

true};

T T

T

T T LT TT T T PP T

One-dimensional lists (Python)
Python replaces arrays with lists, but you can manipulate those lists to behave like arrays.
In Python, data structures don't need to be declared. Square brackets are still used to specify
that the data structure used is a 1D list.
For example, the grades array will look like this:
:

grades =

FPm

[75,64,95,50,34]

e eeee

: grades =

ee e e

1

e e e e e e

ee

mmm e

:

for i in range(5):

:

#stores value entered at given index

:

grades[i]

o

mm s

————— == 1

[0]*5 #creates an array of 5 zeros
#repeats 5 times

= int(input ("enter a value:

e

:

e e e e

e e M e e e R M R e

:

:
"))

:

R M M M e e e e e e

o

e ww ww owm owwoww o

The first line in the code above specifies the initial value each element in the list will take (in this

case, 0). After the *, it is the size of the list (meaning there are five Os in this list at first).
1f you were to write this line of code as grades =

[ ], when trying the FOR loop an

error would be thrown (index out of range), as the size of the list would be none or zero, so

there would not be a way to add any new elements to it. However, the following statement is
completely valid:

T1 grades =

[]

: grades =

[0 for i in range(5)]

1

TTTTTTTT T i1
:

1

And this is possible because the grades list is overwritten. But this could have been just
like this:

1
1

grades =

[0 for i in range(5)]

o o

e

e e e e

e e e e e e e e

:

The purpose of the line above is to initialize the grades list to 0 for all its five elements.
The following two lists are examples of a 1D list of type string and a 1D list of type Boolean:

Construct a program that creates a 1D array or list that stores six integer values. Output true
if the first element in the array is the same as the last element in the array.

2

Construct code that requires the user to enter a number. Use that number as the size of
an array or list of integers to be inputted from the keyboard. Calculate the sum of all even
numbers in the array or list; calculate the average of all its elements; and count how many of
those elements are odd numbers. Display those values.

3

Construct a program that creates an array or list that stores five names. Copy those elements
in a second array or list in reverse order. Display the second array or list.

Use your answers to the programming exercises above to answer the following questions.
1 What data type was your output for question 1? Was it a Boolean or a string variable?
Which one do you think is more appropriate?
2 What was the initial value of the count variable you used for question 2 to count
how many array elements were odd? Why was it important to set an initial value for
this variable?
3 Did the results for question 3 display accurately? What loops did you use to traverse
the arrays? Could those loops have been replaced by other types of loops? Which
are those?

GCommon mistake
Algorithms written to solve a problem should function correctly. When asked to construct an
algorithm that finds the smallest value in a 1D array or 1D list, many candidates initialize a variable
called min to 0 and then compare each element in the array with that one to find a smaller value.
The data structure could store only pasitive numbers; therefore, you will not find a value smaller
than 0.
Remember to initialize that variable to the first element in the array. In this case, if no other
element is smaller, you have already stored the smallest one.

The first value of 3 indicates the number of rows, and the second one the number of columns.

Manipulating 2D arrays or lists requires the use of two loops: the first one for the rows and the
second one for the columns. When addressing one specific item in the array or list, this is done
by using the name of the array or list followed by square brackets that include the row and
column indices.
numbers [0] [2] refers to the element in the array numbers, located at the intersecrion of

the first row with the third column.

The first two count-controlled loops are used to traverse the array (i for the rows and j for the
columns). Then the user is asked to enter a number that is stored in the variable value, which

is then assigned to the array or list numbers.
The last two loops are used to traverse the array or list, so the values stored in the array are
displayed on the screen.
A 2D array can also have a different number of rows and columns.

In the example above, the array numbers will be constructed with two rows and three columns.

B ArraylLists in Java
An ArrayList in Java is a class that allows the use of a dynamic array to store elements, this
time without a pre-defined size. ArrayLists can hold duplicate elements, they allow for random

access and they maintain the insertion order.
To be able to use an ArrayList, you need to import the java.util package:

This will import the entire package, or you can specifically choose to import just the required class:
import java.util.ArrayList;

Keep in mind that, when working with ArrayLists, the data type integer appears as Integer
instead of int.
If the ArrayList will store text, then it would look like this:

To be able to manipulate elements in an ArrayList, there are specific methods that can be used:
Method

Explanation

Code example

add()

Add a new element passed as an argument

grades.add(75);

get()

Access an element at a given position (specified in the brackets)

grades.get(2);

set()

Update an element at a given index (first argument is the index; the | grades.set(2, 64);
second one is the value)

remove()

Delete an item at a specific index

grades.remove(2);

size()

Returns the number of elements in the ArrayList

grades.sizel();

clear()

Delete all elements in the ArrayList

grades.clear();

Arraylist<Integers> grades = new ArraylList<Integers>();
grades.add(75);
! grades.add(64);

LT T T T TP

To traverse an ArrayList, you can use a FOR loop:

grades.add(50);

: grades.add(34);
§

for(int i=0;i<grades.size()
;i++)

{

System.out.println(grades.get(i));

sessnnsnies B

: grades.add (95) ;

B2 Programming

In the code above, the grades ArrayList of type integer is declared. Five elements are added

to the ArrayList. A loop is used to traverse it (the size () method will return the number
of items in the ArrayList to specify how many repetitions will occur), and each element is
retrieved using the get () function and passing the corresponding index of the element that is

then displayed on the screen.
Another example of traversing the ArrayList is by using a FOR-EACH loop instead:
ArrayList<Integers> grades = new ArrayList<Integers();
grades.add(75);
grades.add(64);

grades.add(95);
grades.add(50);
grades.add(34)
;

for

(int i: grades)

{

System.out.println (i) ;

In this example, the variable 1 is not an index, but it is an element in the grades
ArrayList instead.

B Dynamic lists in Python
A dynamic list in Python is a dynamic data structure, meaning it does not have a fixed size.
Dynamic lists can store duplicate values. When creating a dynamic list, you can simply declare
it as an empty list: grades =

[]

However, when wanting to insert a new element, attempting to write something like this:
grades [0]

= 75 will throw an error.

To manipulate dynamic lists, specific methods can be used:
Method

Explanation

Code example

append() | Add a new element passed as an argument at the end of the list

grades.append(75)

insert()

grades.insert(0,64)

Insert a new element at a given index (first argument is the index,
the second is the value to be inserted)

remove() | Delete the first occurrence of a given item passed as an argument

grades.remove(75)

popl()

Delete the element at the specified index

grades.pop|(0)

popl)

Delete the last element if no index is given

grades.popl)

clear()

Empty the entire list

grades.clear()

len()

Return the size of the list

len(grades)

To loop through a dynamic list, a FOR loop can be used:
grades=[]
grades.append (75)
grades.append (64)
grades.append (95)

grades.append (50)
grades.append (34)
for i in range

(len(grades)):

print (grades[i])

B2.2 Data structures

Another way to achieve the same is:
grades=1[]

grades.append
(75)
grades.append
(64)
grades.append
(95)
grades.append
(50)
grades.append
(34)
for i in grades:
print (i)

In this case, i is not the index, but an element in the dynamic list.

B2.2.3 Stacks
If you were a bank cashier, you would deal with lots of coins. To easily manipulate those, the
coins are categorized based on their values and stored in piles, for example a pile of 10p coins,
a stack of 20p coins, another stack of 50p coins, and so on. When the cashier needs one of

these coins, they would get it from the top of the pile containing the required coin value, so the
stack remains intact. When the cashier needs to add a new coin to one of the piles, they would
add the new coin to the pile; again, on top of it.
B2 Programming

Another example would be a stack of plates: a new plate is
added to the top of the stack and a plate is removed from
the top of the stack, otherwise plates can break.

In Computer Science, when performing actions that work
on the same principle, a specific abstract data structure
called stack can be used. The stack works on the principle
of Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO),

meaning that only the top element is accessed. The
operation of removing an item from the stack is called
pop, which means taking off the top element, while the
operation of adding an item to the stack is called push,
meaning adding an item to the top of the stack.

B Uses of stacks
Stacks are used when storing data in the order they occurred and when it might be necessary to
track back to a certain point or action in the past, as they respect the LIFO principle of operation.
Stacks can be used:

B
4 Interrupt handling:
handling interrupt
reguests.

# Interrupt: a signal
sent from a device or
software to request the
processor’s attention;

the processor will stop
its current activity
until the interrupt has
been serviced.
# Recursion: a process
that uses a function
or procedure that is
defined in terms of itself

to create an UNDO feature in games: actions are pushed into the stack; when undoing,

actions are popped
m

to allow backwards navigation on a web browser: pressing the back button performs a pop
operation; opening a new website performs a push operation

m for interrupt handling: when the current activity of the CPU is interrupted, the content of
variables and return addresses are stored in a stack; after the interrupt is dealt with, those
are popped from the stack to restore its activiry

B to evaluate arithmetic expressions: when evaluating RPN (reverse polish notation)
expressions, the operands are pushed on to the stack; when an operator is met, if it

is a binary operator (requires two operands) two more pop operations will occur, the
calculation is performed and the result is pushed back into the stack — the process will

data structure that
works on the FIFO
principle.

A queue is a data structure that functions on the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. An example

# First In First Out

of a queue is a line of people waiting to check out at a grocery store. The first to join the queue is

element inserted is the
first element removed.

the first to leave. A new person who joins the line will enter at the end of the queue.
A queue uses a front pointer to show where elements will be removed from and a rear pointer
to show where elements will be added to.

B2.2 Data structures

A queue can be implemented as a static data structure
using arrays (it will have a fixed size, and it is possible to
become full as this fixed size cannot be exceeded). Or, a
queue can be implemented as a dynamic data structure,
using a linked list (which would not have a fixed size).
When a queue is implemented as an array, it can often be

seen and managed as a circular queue. This is in case there
are elements removed from the queue, so that there is still

a way to add new elements, even if the last index has been
reached, as the queue will not actually be full. In a circular

queue, if the rear pointer becomes equal to the front
pointer after an item is added, the queue becomes full; it
they become equal after an item is removed, the queue
becomes empty.

Bl Uses of queues
Queues are used when dealing with simulations or situations that require the first item entered
to be the first item dealt with. Applications of queues include:

to be dealt with. New printing jobs join the queue at the rear of the queue. As such, all

a queue.

printing jobs are dealt with on a first come first served basis.
Keyboard queues: The keyboard buffer (which stores characters as they are typed) operates
as a queue. As such, the first letter to be shown on the screen is the first letter typed. New
characters are added to the end of the queue.
Simulations of real-life situations: Checkout queues, car-washing queues, carpark-exiting
queues, and so on, are all situations that require a queue. People or cars enter the queue on
one side and exit it on the other side.

B2.2 Data structures

(;Common mistake
When required to state applications of a data structure, such as a queue or stack, students often

lose marks for not being clear enough to gain the marks. For example, saying that stacks are used
to undo would not be enough to gain any marks.
Be specific and explain a clear situation where an undo feature is needed, such as implementing
an undo feature in games: actions are pushed on to the stack and, when the previous action is
needed, the undo feature is used to pop the top action from the stack.
