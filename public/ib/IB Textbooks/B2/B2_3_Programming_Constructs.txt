SYLLABUS CONTENT
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
» B2.3.1 Construct programs that implement the correct sequence of code instructions to
meet program objectives

» B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures to perform repeated actions
» B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization

B2.3.1 Sequencing
When solving problems, the order in which the statements are executed matters. Taking the
swapping example in section B2.1, if you were to change the order of the instructions it would

produce an incorrect output:
a

=>=5

b =7
a=>b

// 7 is stored into a

temp = a

// 7 is saved into the temporary variable temp

b = temp

// 7

(from temporary variable)

is stored into b

Here, even if they are the same statements, the result will be incorrect just because they are not
in the right order. In this example, in the end both variables, a and b, will store the value 7. As
such, no swapping occurred, even if a temporary variable was introduced exactly as was done
in the correct algorithm.
# Sequence: to

Sequence refers to the instructions being executed once and in the exact order they are written.

execute instructions
one after another in the

outcome, which could lead to incorrect functionality (as demonstrated above), logic errors or

given order.

Tollowing the right order of the instructions is important in programming, as this impacts the
infinite loops.

B2.3.2 Selection structures
B Selection or branching structures
Selection is a programming construct used to decide what statement(s), if any, are to be
executed based on one or more given conditions.
Conditions are usually built using logic operators. IF statements are an example of selection
or branching structures. The condition in the IF statement is evaluated: if it evaluates to
true, specific statements are executed; otherwise, nothing happens, or other statements

are executed.

In this case, nothing happens if the condition is not met. As an example, this structure could

be used in a situation where a buyer receives a discount of 20 per cent if their purchase value is
100 or more. As such, if their purchase value is below 100, nothing happens.

B2 Programming

Java
private static Scanner read;
public static void main(String[] args)
read = new Scanner (System.in) ;
double purchaseValue,

{

discount;

discount=0;

System.out .println("enter value of goods purchased:
H

");
:

purchaseValue = read.nextDouble
() ;
if

(purchaseValue>=100)

discount = purchaseValue * 0.2;
System.out.println("Your discount is:

"

+ discount);

In this example, the purchaseValue and discount variables have been declared as
double because they are meant to store an amount of money, which could be a decimal value.

As the discount is only calculated if the condition is met, we had to initialize it to 0 in the
beginning, so there is a value to display if no calculation occurs. The indentation inside the
IF statement in the Python below shows what instruction is going to be executed when the

condition is met. In Java, the indentation is replaced by curly brackets and, if those are missing,

e e e e ee e e e e R e e R e R R R e e e e e R e e e e e e

discount = 0
purchaseValue= float (input ("Enter the value of your goods:"))

if purchasevValue>=100:
discount = purchaseValue * 0.2
print ("Your discount is

",

discount)

]
]
1
]

o

then the next line will be interpreted as belonging to the selection statement. Therefore, the output
statement will be run independently of the given condition, as it is not included in the IF statement.

o

[

In Python, there is no need to declare the variables, so only the discount variable is
initialized to 0. However, the input value is converted to £loat, to ensure the user will enter a
decimal number (integers are included into the range of decimal values). If the float conversion

did not happen, the user’s input value would be a text, and this would throw an error when
attempting to use it in calculations.

You can further expand this code and include a variable to store and display the due amount:

: Java
E

:

double purchaseValue,toPay,

discount;

E

i toPay=0;

|

i System.out.println("enter the wvalue of your goods:
E

purchaseValue = read.nextDouble
() ;

");

i
E

i if

(purchasevalue>=100)

E

discount = purchaseValue * 0.2;

E

i

toPay = purchaseValue - discount;

]

{

! System.out.println("You need to pay:

B2.3 Programming constructs

:

" + toPay);

i

In the example above, you need the brackets to indicate that both calculations will happen
only if the condition is met.

toPay = 0

purchaseValue= float (input ("Enter the walue of your goods:"))
if purchaseValue>=100:
discount = purchaseValue * 0.2
toPay = purchaseValue - discount
print ("You need to pay: ", toPay)

In Python, the indentarion replaces the brackets, so they are not included.
The IF statement can be further expanded to include an ELSE. The statements corresponding
to the ELSE are the statements that will be executed if the condition evaluates to false instead.
IF condition THEN

Note that the brackets can still be used even if only a single instruction is included in the IF or
ELSE part.

As you may have realized, the block of code can even be further expanded to include another
I statement inside the current one. (One IF statement inside another is called a “nested IF".)

In this case, a new variable was included that will decide whether the discount is 20 per cent
or 10 per cent, depending on whether or not the buyer is a member. Also, observe that, as there
is no requirement to display the discount value, you could have calculated the due amount by

simply multiplying the purchase price by 0.9, thus applying the discount of 10 per cent.

The value input and stored into the member variable should be a Boolean value. However, if
there is an attempt to check whether the value entered is True or False by using the bool
keyword instead of eval, it will not return the right answer: bool checks whether or not
the string entered is empty and, as the user will write True or False, the value of the variable
member will always be True as the string is not empty. Therefore, the eval function is used
in this situation, to ensure the value entered is evaluated to True or False and then stored

into the member variable.

B2 Programming

However, there is another way of solving this problem, by using the and logic operator in
the condition.

if

(purchaseValue>=100 && member==true)

{

discount = purchaseValue * 0.2;
toPay = purchaseValue-discount;
} else if

(purchasevValue>=100 && member==false)

{

toPay = purchaseValue*0.9;

} else {
toPay = purchaseValue;

!
System.out .println("You should pay:

........................................................................................................ Baessssasasssitstisisntattn

In the example above, both conditions should be met (to be a member and purchase value to be

100 or above) for the discount of 20 per cent to be applied. The second condition is checking
whether both conditions are met again, but this time they should have a purchase value of 100
or above, but not be a member. The statement executed on the else branch is the statement
happening if the purchase is not 100 or above.

In Python, else if isreplaced by the keyword elif.
Conditions can use other logic operators, such as OR and NOT.
In case you wanted the discount to be applied if the purchase value was 100 or above or the

buyer owned a membership card, the OR operator would replace the AND operator in the
condition above, for example:
[

As in the example above, a comparison with a true value can be written by using the
conditional statement if, followed by the variable that needs to be evaluated to true:
if (member)

This will evaluate to TRUE if the member stores the value true, and to FALSE otherwise.
Therefore, the expression if

(!

member) inJavaor if not member: in Python would

return TRUE if the member variable stores a value of false, and it would return FALSE if the

variable stores true; this expression being read as if not member.
Other relational operators can be part of the comparison, such as: ==, 1=, <, >, <=
Because = is used in assignments, == is used in comparisons to check for equality.

How does reasoning affect decision-making?
Reasoning involves analyzing, evaluating and drawing conclusions from given facts, data and
processes between them. Those are important skills in making effective decisions, as they allow you
to clearly define problems and goals, by selecting the relevant details and ignoring the unnecessary
ones, analysing possible solutions, generating ideas and proposing efficient solutions.
The word “decision” cames from the Latin decidere, meaning "to cut off”. In order to make a
decision you need to consider and cut off alternative solutions. Reasoning plays a critical role in first
identifying available options and then evaluating their consequences. However, decision-making
often involves a blend of reasoning and other factors that may constrain rationality, such as biases
and emotions.
In exploring the role of reasoning in dedision-making, discuss the importance of logic, analysis,
critical thinking, problem-solving techniques, acquired skills and purpose in reaching well-informed
and effective conclusions.

Thinkers: Use critical and creative thinking skills to analyse and take responsible action
on complex problems. Exercise initiative in making reasoned decisions.

B2.3.3 Loops and iteration
Consider a scenario where you need to display your name multiple times. Initially, you might
achieve this by writing individual print statements for each repetition. However, this approach

quickly becomes cumbersome when dealing with a larger number of repetitions, such as
100 times. Moreover, if you want to repeat the actions based on user input or until a certain

condition is met, manually writing each repetition becomes impractical. To handle such
situations efficiently, loops come into play.
Loops provide a way to execute a block of cade repeatedly, either for a predetermined number
of iterations or until a specific condition is satisfied. Whether you know the exact number of

repetitions in advance, or need to iterate dynamically based on runtime conditions, loops offer
a flexible and concise solution.
Loops are used to repeat different instructions or blocks of code. One loop refers to one
repetition. There are several types of loops, such as count-controlled loops (FOR loops) and
conditional loops. Conditional loops can be pre-condition loops (WHILE loops) or postcondition loops (REPEAT-UNTIL loops).

B Count-controlled loop
A count-controlled loop (FOR loop) is used when the number of repetitions is known in advance,
prior to the execution of the code. For example, if you need to write all the numbers between

1 and 100, before writing any code it can be said that the program will repeat 100 times.

B Count-controlled loop flowchart

If n is the number of repetitions required, a FOR loop would look like this:

Python
for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)

{

for i in range

//code to be repeated

(0,n):

#code to be repeated

}
In Java, i = 0 is the starting point of the repetition, so 1 is initialized to 0.

1<n is the

condition to be met so, when 1 is no longer smaller than n, the repetition will stop. As the
variable 1 was initially 0 to avoid running the code to infinite, the value of i needs to be
changed with every reperition. In this case, i is incremented (i++).
In Python, the range indicates the initial value of i (in this case, 0) and the ending value of i
(in this case, n). Note here that the code will stop when i becomes n-1. For example, ifn =
5, 1 will take the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. There are five repetitions in total; when i reaches the

value of 5, the repetition will stop and so the value won't be displayed.
In the example above, because the starting point is 0, which is the default value, the statement
could have been written as for i in range (n) : and it would have had the same effect.
In both Java and Python, the starting point can be changed. Consider that you must display all
the numbers between 1 and 100. To solve this problem, you can set the starting point to 1 and
the ending point to 101, ensuring 100 is also included.

The Java example could have used the less-than-or-equal-to sign in the condition to ensure the
upper bound of 100 is included. Alternatively, the loop could have been maintained to iterate
from 0 to 100, with the printing statement adjusted to display the value of 1+1

i%2==1 checks whether the remainder of division by 2 of the variable i is 1. In other words,
if there is a remainder, the number is odd; if there is no remainder, the number is even.
The same problem can be solved without the need to use an IT statement. A step can be
included to change the incrementation so, instead of incrementing the value of i by 1, which is
the default value, it increments it by a ditferent value.

In Java, the starting point is set to 100, so that value is displayed first. The condition is
changed, as you want to repeat as long as the value is greater than 0, and also the step is
changed to decrement the value instead of incrementing it. i=1-1 could be written as i--.

In Python, the range is changed to start at 100. It should stop when it reaches 1 (0 is not
touched) and the step is set to —1, so the number is decremented by 1.

A pre-condition (WHILE) loop is used when the number of repetitions is not known prior to

the two entries to check if they match (double entry verification). In this case, a loop would be

used to repeat entering the password until the two inputs match.

password = "apple";
System.out.println("Re-enter the password:");

$

pass = read.nextLine();

{

System.out .println("Re-enter the password:");
pass = read.nextLine();

}
System.out.println("The two passwords matched");
........... T T

L

I

T

ey

In this case, .equals is used to compare the value stored in password with the one stored
in pass, as those two values are of type string. If the two values were numbers, then ==
would be used for comparison. The ! is a negation, therefore, in this case, it is checking if the

two values are not the same, and the user is asked to re-enter the password until the two values
match. The outpur at the end will be displayed only after the loop is exited. If the second

password never matches the first, the code inside the loop will continuously repeat.
Any FOR loop can be rewritten as a WHILE loop. Considering our example that displays all
the numbers between 1 and 100, using a WHILE loop the code would look like this:

Java
int i = 1;
while (i<101)
:

{

E Python

:

:

i=1

: while(i<101):

System.out .println(i);

:

print (i)

:

i = i+1;

:

i=i+1

:

In the example above, the loop will repeat as long as i is smaller than 101. The termination
condition will be that 1 >=101. The role of the incrementation is to change the value ot i, so
the loop will stop at one moment. Otherwise, without that statement, the loop would run
to infinite.

multiple programmers can work together, each developing a function and then those functions
can be put together to build up a more complex program. Once a function has been written
and tested, the programmer can reuse it without worrying about its functionality.
Writing maintainable code is an important skill for any programmer. Maintainable code refers
to code that is clear; easy to read and modify; and can be reused by the programmer themself
or by other programmers. Using functions aids in the creation of maintainable code.
Such a reusable block of code is called a procedure or a function; the difference between the
two being the returned value(s). A procedure can take several parameters or none and it has no

can simply be displayed.
Consider the following problem: A user is required to provide two whole numbers. Construct a
program that calculates the sum of the two numbers and displays it.
A simple solution would be to ask the user to enter the two numbers, add them together and
display the result, such as:

Java
read = new Scanner (System.in) ;
:

int nol,

!

System.out.println("enter
nol:");
(

no2,

sum;

i:

nol = read.nextInt();
(

System.out.println("enter no2:");

(

no2 = read.nextInt ()
sum = nol+noz;
System.out.println("The result is

:

: no2 = int(input ("enter no2:"))

:

:

sum = nol + no2

: print ("The result is ", sum)

M Solution 1

But if you needed to perform the same operation again, with different values, you would have
to rewrite the code, which is not very time or memory efficient. Therefore, to complete such

tasks, a procedure is required.

M Solution 3

In the code above, the same procedure is created, but two parameters are passed to it {(nol
and no2). When the procedure is called in the main program, the values being passed to it are
called “arguments” (valuel and value2).

When a return is added to the block of code, the procedure becomes a function. The returned
value can be displayed on the screen or used in other mathematical expressions. The number
of parameters also differs when it comes to functions: one, none or more parameters can be
passed to a function.

When implementing functions in Java, the void keyword from the method signature is
replaced by the data type of the value being returned.

wvalue2))

newVal = 3
newVal = newVal + add(valuel,

print ("The new value is ",

newVal)

In the example above, the function add will return a value of data type integer.
The function is called once to be displayed and the other time to increase the value of the

variable newval.

Qutline the difference between validation and verification. Provide an example where a

4

Differentiate between pre- and post-condition loops.

1

Construct code to let the user create a function called factorial that takes a natural
number (n) as a parameter. The function should return the factorial value of that number (n!).

2

Construct a program that consists of a procedure called odds that takes a natural number (n)
as a parameter. The procedure should display all the odd numbers from 1 to that number (n).

3

Construct code that creates a function called perfect that takes n (a natural number) as a

parameter. The function should return true/false if n is a perfect number.
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors,

excluding the number itself. For example, 28 is a perfect number as its proper divisors
are: 1, 2,4, 7, 14. Adding those values together we get 28, and this result is equal to the
initial number.
4

Construct a function called palindrome that takes a word as a parameter. The function

should return true/false if the given word is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards or backwards. For example, kayak,
racecar, level and civic are all palindromes.

B2.3 Programming constructs

B Scope of variables
# Local variable: a
variable that exists only
within the block of code
where it is defined.
# Global variable:
a variable that exists

Based on their scope, variables can be classified into various categories, such as local or
global variables.
The scope of the variable defines its lifetime in the program, meaning the block of code where
it has been declared, where it can be used and modified. How and where the variables are
declared detines the scope.

throughout a program.

Local variables

4 Variable scope: the
lifetime of a variable

Local variables are variables that have their scope limited to the block of code within which

determines whether you
can access and maodify
the variable within a
specific block of code.

they are declared and used.
Once that block of code is executed, the variable is automarically removed from the memory.

It is recommended to use local variables as often as possible. An example of a local variable
is when using a counter in a FOR loop. That counter is required only within the body of the

loop for storing temporary data but, once the loop is finished, you do not need that counter
any longer.

¢ Java: i is a local variable

for(int i=0; i<3;i++) {
System.out.println("helloc world");
T
P T PP srrrrrsnrens srrrrssnrane B
L R TP PR TP PPCETTRYS sarasrsanans s

As i is a local variable, it exists within the loop, and it will take values trom 0 to 3. When it

reaches 3, the variable is no longer smaller than 3 and the repetition will stop. After this loop,
the variable i does not exist any longer.

Python: text is a local variable
def hello():
# text is the local wvariable
text =

"hello world"

print (text)
# code to text
hello()
# the print below will throw an error as text does not exist
# outside the procedure
print (text)

In this example, text is the local variable. When printing the variable text inside the
subprocedure, the message “hello world” will be displayed. However, when attempting to print
the text again, after the call of the method, an error will be thrown as text is used without

having an initial value.

Global variables
Global variables are variables that are visible and accessible throughout the program.
In Python, the global variables are initialized at the top of the code or module and, whenever

they are used within a function or procedure, they are declared as global. As Java is an

B2 Programming

object-oriented programming language, it does not use the concept of global variables.
However, by using the static or static final keywords, the variables can have all the
properties of global variables.

Python
text =

"hello

"

def hello():
# text is a global wvariable

global text
# text is concatenated with a new text wvalue
text = text +

"world"

# Driver code
hello()
print (text)

B

e

L

T

L L

e

In this example, the text is a global variable, which means that, by calling the hello

procedure, the content of the variable text is changed and, once it is printed, even if it is
printed outside the procedure, it will display the updated content: hello world.

(.-Top tip!
When writing code, aim to preponderantly use local variables rather than global variables. Local
variables are confined to the function or block in which they are dedared, promoting encapsulation
and modularity. This makes functions self-contained and easier to understand, test and debug.
Global variables can be madified by any part of the code, leading to unintended side effects that
can make the program behaviour difficult to predict and debug. Local variables prevent such side
effects by limiting the scope of variable modifications.

Trace the following program to determine its output.

public static void changeOfName (String st)

{

System.out.println("Student inside the method:

changeOfName (student) ;

System.out.println("Student outside the method:

def changeOfName
(st) :

st = "Bobby"
print ("Student inside the method:

changeOfName (student)
print ("Student outside the method:

student)

Identify a local variable in the code above. Explain why the chosen variable is not a
global variable.
Construct a program that changes the code above so that, after the method is executed,
both outputs display the name lim, without changing the first line of code.
Construct code to update the method above to include a validation check: the new name

should be input from the keyboard and the change should occur only if the new name is
different from the previous name. Display a message if the new name is not different and
display the current name.

Identify the scope and data type of the variable you have created to validate the
name change.

B2.1.3 Exception handling
‘When a computer program is run, different reasons or events might cause the program to halt
or produce an unexpected outcome. These reasons could include logical errors in the code,
unexpected user inputs or resource unavailability.
# Logic error: an error

in a program that makes
it operate incorrectly;
it will not crash the
program.
# Runtime error: an

error that occurs when
executing a program,
the program might stop
unexpectedly.
# Exception handling:
a process of responding
to an exception, so the

Logic errors refer to incorrect sequences in the logic of the program, incorrect choices of
condition or incorrect calculations. For example, when attempting to calculate the average of
three numbers, dividing the sum of the three numbers by 2 instead of dividing it by 3 would

produce an incorrect outcome.
Such errors can only be detected through testing, as they would pass the compilation stage.
Runtime errors could cause the program to crash. These errors refer to problems occurring
as the program runs, such as division by 0; a file not being found; truncation; overflow or
underflow errors; a hardware device not being available, such as a printer not being ready; or a
class tile not being found.

Also, a user can enter unexpected inputs, such as entering text instead of a number or entering
values that would lead to an attempt to divide by 0, or entering the wrong file location to read

All those events can be dealt with, so the program does not crash, using exception handling.

wrong, and they can continue attempting other features of the program.
The role of exception handling techniques is to maintain the normal flow of the program, by

catching and throwing exceptions that cannot be handled locally. In Java, this takes the form
of try/catch blocks, while in Python they are found as try/except blocks. The code

that might throw an error is written within the try block and the exception is caught and
displayed, if needed, in the catch/except block. Both languages allow for a finally block
that is found at the end of the try/catch or try/except block and this includes code
that will always execute after leaving the try statement, regardless of the try block outcome:

whether or not it raises an error.
