Boolean
Boolean is used to store one of the two possible values: true or false. So, a Boolean variable
could be used to store such data as whether or not a product is still in stock; whether or not a
person is a male; whether or not a trip has been paid for, and so on.

Boolean variables are often used to evaluate logic expressions. In code, conditions often need
to be added and, if the condition would evaluate to true, some statements would be executed;
otherwise, different statements would be executed.

Another example of the need for a Boolean variable would be to continue repeating a piece of
code as long as an expression evaluates to true or false, based on the requirements.
Consider the following variables:a = 7andb = 54.
((a<9)

and (b=>30)) evaluates to true: if both conditions evaluate to true, the result is

true. 7 is smaller than 9 and 54 is greater than 30 (both conditions are met).
((a=3)

or

(b<3))

evaluates to true: if either condition is true, the result is true. (The

Communicators: Express yourself confidently and creatively in many ways. Collaborate
effectively with and listen carefully to the perspectives of other class members.
Communication skills: Use appropriate forms of writing for different purposes and
audiences. Explore and create a table to present to the class the different ranges
available for the data types you have studied.

B Assignments
Assignment refers to setting a value to a variable; this operartion is typically carried out using

the equals sign (=). The value on the right of the equals sign is assigned to the variable on the
left side of the equals sign; it can never be done the other way around.
count = 1
This statement assigns the value of 1 to the variable count. In other words, count is now 1.
But you will often see statements like this: count = count + 1. This statement means that
the variable count is incremented (or increased) by one, or its new value is one greater than

4 Increment: to
increase a value by
another value (usually

it was. Incrementing a variable by one is a special case, and you can also write it as count++.

by one).

Another example is when you decrease the variable by a value other than one, such as:

4 Decrement: to
decrease a value by
another value (usually
by one).

If ++ means the variable is incremented by one, decrementing a variable by one becomes
count--orcount = count - 1.

price

5000

price

price - 100

Here, the variable price becomes 100 lower than it was. So, it was initially 5000, and
after the second line of code is executed the new price is 4900. When assigning new values
to variables, the previous value is overwritten, so the variable occupies the same memory
location. Therefore, in this case, after the two lines of code are executed, the value of 5000 is

completely lost.
As such, a challenging question would be: how do you swap the contents of two variables?
Imagine that you have two variables, a and b, storing the values 5 and 7 in this exact order.
How could you swap their contents, and end up with a storing the value of 7 and b storing the
value of 57
One attempt to solve the problem might be the following:
a=>5
b =17
a=>
b =a

If you have been tempted to do this, what happens is that you end up with two variables
storing the same value; in this case, 7. On line 3, the variable a becomes 7, and on line 4, the
variable b becomes a, which means b becomes 7 as well.

B2 Programming

Therefore, to solve such a problem, you need to imagine that, instead of numbers, you are
dealing with liquids. Imagine that the variable a is a cup that is filled with water, and the
variable b is a cup filled with tea. What you want is to swap the contents of your cups: the water
to get into cup b and the tea into cup a. You cannot mix those contents, so what is the solution?

A third cup! The solution is to bring in a third cup, which will temporarily hold the content of
one of your cups. So, you pour the water into cup c. Cup a is now available to store the content

of cup b, which is the tea. After this step, you can pour the water from cup c into cup b. By doing
this, your contents are swapped successfully. The example below shows you how this works

with numbers:
a=2=5

b=17
temp = a

// 5 is saved into the temporary variable temp

a=>b

// 7 is stored into a

b = temp

// 5

(from temporary variable)

Initial state of the variables.

Step 1: content of a is copied
into temp.

B2.1 Programming fundamentals (part 1)

is stored into b

Step 2: content of the
variable b is copied into a.

The content of a is overwritten.
Step 3: content of the
variable temp is copied
into b.

Now the content
of the two variables
a and b is swapped.

Although this might seem an irrelevant challenge right now, this swapping method is part of
several sorting routines that you will study later.

Arithmetic operators are used to perform calculations such as addition, multiplication,
subtraction, and so on. The arithmetic operators presented so far are binary operators,
meaning they require two operands (two values) to apply the calculation on. There are also
unary operators (that require only one operand), such as:

# Unary operator: an
operator that reguires
one single operand.
4 Integer division:
division in which
the fractional part is

While it is quite straightforward to understand when you would use the addition, subtraction

or multiplication operators, it might be a bit trickier to understand what the div and mod
operators are.

Div: division operator
In Java and Python, there are two types of division: integer division and floating-point division.
Both types use the same symbol (forward slash) in Java. However, when dividing two integer
values, the result will be an integer (integer division); when dividing two floating-point
number numbers or a decimal and an integer, the result will be a decimal number (floatingpoint division).

Java

H

int nol

7;

int no2

i

System.out.println(nol/no2);

H

In the example above, even if the result would be 3.5, the answer displayed would be 3, as the
two numbers are whole numbers (integers).
.......................................................................... e

double nol = 7.0;
double no2 = 2.0;

System.out.println(nol/no2) ;

However, in this example, as both variables store decimal numbers, the result displayed is a
decimal number as well (3.5).

Java
float nol = 7.0;
int no2 = 2;
System.out.println(nol/no2) ;

In the example above, the values stored are numbers of mixed data types, and the result will
be a decimal number: 3.5.

B2.1 Programming fundamentals (part 1)

H

In Python, as the type of variables is not specified, there are different operators to represent
the different types of divisions. Floating-point division is performed by the / (forward slash)
operator, so the result will be a decimal number. However, integer division uses the // (double

slash) operator. // will return the floor division (this means that, no matter the result, it

will always round it down — what happens is that the decimal part is truncated or, in simpler
words, it is ignored or deleted.

B2.1.2 String manipulation
In coding, there is often a need to manipulate text. You might want to display some special
characters, such as double quotations " ", single quotations ' ' or a backslash \.
As those characters are already used for a specific purpose in most programming languages,

displaying them might be challenging. At the same time, programmers might want to extract
parts of text belonging to a string, join them together, alter or delete them. Iow is all this possible?
Inchuding an escape character (backslash) supports typing special characters that are usually
used for specific purposes in the language. For example, single quotations are used for storing a
character in Java or even a string in Python; the same happens with double quotations. Therefore,
when wanting to include single or double quotations in the text, you must use the backslash:
Character

W

B Text blocks
In Java, multiple line strings can be written like this:

¢ Java
System.out.println("Write multiple\n"

i + "Lines like this");
Text on different lines is joined together via the + operator. \n represents the new line

character, denoting that the new line of text will be displayed on the next line.

P -

In Python, multiple line strings can be written by using triple double quotation marks:

Python
print (""" Write multiple
Lines like this
nn Il)

The programming language offers several built-in functions that can be used to

manipulate strings.
In the examples below, text is a variable that stores a piece of text, such as: “Computer
Science is fun!”

H Length
The length function returns the length (number of characters, spaces included) of the value
stored in the string text. In this situation, the value stored in x is 24.

B Concatenation
# Concatenation:

joining strings together.

Concatenation refers to joining two or more string values together.
Both Java and Python allow several ways to achieve concatenation. One of them is with the +
operator, which will join the two strings together.

. Java

:

String partl = "Computer Science is fun";
String part2 = ",

isn't it?";

String text = partl + part2;
System.out.println(text) ;

Another function that can be used in Java to concatenate two strings is the function concat:

. Java
String partl = "Computer Science is fun";
String part2 = ",

isn't it?";

String text = partl.concat(part2);
System.out.println(text) ;

Note that concatenation is a technique that is applied to a series of string variables, rather than a
combination of strings and integers or decimals. If there is a need to concatenate a combination
of strings and integers, the + operator can be used in Java, or the integer or decimal value can
be converted to a string prior to the concatenation taking place. In Python, the interpolation
operator (%), the str function, str. format or £-strings can be used for this purpose.

H Substring
substring is the function that is used to retrieve part of the string, for example if you want
to extract the first word or letter in a string, or the text between specific positions in the string,
Note thar the first position in a string is 0.
In Java, the function used tor this purpose is called substring:

Java
String text = "Computer Science is fun";
String part = text.substring(8);
System.out.println(part} ;

By providing one argument to the substring function, it indicates the starting index of the
text to be extracted. In this example, the output would be “Science is fun” as the variable part

will be assigned the value from the string, starting with position 8 until the end of the string.
B2.1 Programming fundamentals (part 1)

String text = "Computer Science is fun";
String part

text.substring(8,16) ;

System.out.println(part) ;
Tesesssssasranninnannns PErrT B

T T T LT T T

T T LT T T TP

PPN sessssans :

In the example above, the call of the substring function is passed two arguments. The first
one (8) indicates the starting index (position in string) and the second one (16) indicates the

ending index. The substring produced will be from starting index until the ending index —1.

Therefore, the text produced in this example will be “Science”. This is the case because “S”
is the letter at index 8 and “e” is the letter at index 15. The letter at index 16, which is a space
character, is not included.
In Python, the substring function is often referred to as slicing.

The code above extracts the first character of the text variable: “C".
L ettt -

Python
text = "Computer Science is fun"
part = text[:5]

In this case, the part will include the first five characters from the text: “Compu”, as “C” is in
position 0 and “u” in position 4.

i Python

i

|

Because the index is —1, this piece of code will store the last character into the string part; in
this case, the letter “n”.

Python
text =

"Computer Science is fun"

part = text[-6:]
print (part)

In this example, the last six characters in the string will be assigned to the variable part: “is fun”.

B2 Programming

Python
text = "Computer Science is fun"
part

text [1:-4]

print (part)

Above, the extracted text will start at index 1 and will end at the last index —4. So, the value
stored in the variable part is “omputer Science is”.

B Replace
The replace method searches a string for a character or set of characters and replaces it or
them with another character or with other characters.

Java

i

String text =

"Computer Science is fun";

text = text.replace('e',

'@');

System.out.println(text) ;

In Java, the replace method will replace one single character, so the text now becomes
“Comput@r Sci@nc@ is fun”. To replace several characters, the replacefll method should
be used.

Java
String text = "Computer Science is fun";
text = text.replaceAll("is",

"will be");

System.out.println(text}) ;

In Python, the replace method is used for replacing both one single character and
more characters.

B Strip
Sometimes, when reading values from a text file or any permanent storage, you might want to
remove the trailing white spaces. This can be achieved by using the strip method.
B2.1 Programming fundamentals (part 1)

Some versions of Java accept t riminstead of strip for the same purpose:

: Java
! String text =

Computer Science is fun

!

"

:

text = text.trim();
System.out.println(text) ;

The leading and trailing spaces will be removed, therefore the new text that will be output is:
“Computer Science is fun !”

To achieve the same output in Python, you can use the st rip function:

text = "

Computer Science is fun

!

"

text = text.strip()

print (text)

How does knowledge in Computer Science develop?
Knowledge in Computer Science develops through a dynamic interplay of various Ways of Knowing

advancements, while intuition, creativity and ethical considerations shape the broader impact and
direction of the field. The interdisciplinary nature of Computer Science ensures that it continually
evolves, influenced by and influencing other domains of knowledge. This multifaceted development
makes Computer Science a rich field for TOK debates, highlighting the complexity and depth of how

The exception handling construct can include only a try/catch block in Java, or justa
try/except block in Python. There is no need to specifically indicate the type of error that
might have caused the program to crash, but this is useful to help the programmer debug the
code and fix issues that might be solved or to let the user understand the problem if the wrong
input is provided.

(;Key information
"Exception” refers to the event that interrupts the execution of a program, while “exception

from halting unexpectedly. For example, a division by 0 is an exception; using a try/catch or try/

B2.1.4 Debugging techniques
# Debugging: finding
and fixing errors in
a program.
# Trace table: a
technigue used to test
an algorithm, and to
predict how it will be
run and how values of
variables will change.
# Breakpoint: a
marker to interrupt the
execution of code for
debugging purposes.

Debugging refers to finding and fixing errors in code. Common debugging techniques include
trace tables, breakpoint debugging, print statements and step-by-step code execution.

B Trace tables
Trace tables represent a technique usually used at design stage to test an algorithm and predict
step by step how it will run. They can be used to demonstrate the outcome of an algorithm or
to identity logic errors.
A trace table is a table in which the columns represent variables, conditions or an output in the
algorithm. However, not all variables, conditions or outputs are always needed; this depends
on the purpose of the trace table.
Its role is to identify how variables change, what conditions evaluate to and what are
the produced outcomes. By producing a trace table, the purpose of the algorithm can be
determined or any flaws in the algorithm can be detected.

every term, the number of students is unknown. Therefore, the teacher will enter 999 to

terminate the program. The teacher is required to identify the number of students passing
the assessment.

The following flowchart has been designed to suggest a possible solution to the problem:

count <- 0

i

INPUT score

;

w Yes —l

No

score >= 80

Yesj

OUTPUT count, " students have
passed the exam”

count <- count + 1

No

|

The trace table for the input data would look like this:
23,08, 33, 45, 78, 80, 81, 84, 34,999
count

45
78
80

2

81

3

84

4

34
999

4 students have passed the exam

B2 Programming

When the value 98 is entered, the count is incremented. 33, 43, 78 will not affect the count,

so its value stays the same. You might choose to repeat the previous value for the count
variable, or just leave it blank as there is no change. Be aware if there is a statement reassigning
the value of the variable to something, then even if the value is the same as the previous one,

it should appear within the count column, as that is a change to the variable. When value 80
is entered, the count is incremented again, and the procedure repeats for the values 81 and

84, but nothing happens to the count when 34 is entered. 999 is the value that will terminate
the program, and so the output will be displayed, as the output is displayed only after 999 is

entered, in this example.

B Breakpoint debugging
Breakpoints are special markers that interrupt the execution of the code for debugging

purposes. To set a breakpoint in Eclipse IDE, it is sufficient to right-click on the blue section
beside the line number and toggle a breakpoint as shown in the screenshot below (this differs
from IDE to IDE).

M Breakpoint debugging in Eclipse

B2 Programming

After setting up the breakpoints, the next step is to run the program in debugging mode. This
is done by clicking on the Debug button (the one next to the Run button), which looks like a
little bug, as shown in the image below.

To monitor and see what happens with the variables, you have to press Step into / Step over
or use Step filters buttons. If you want to check what happens at the breakpoint line then you
would choose the Step into button, but if you want to skip that line and execute the following

one you would choose the Step over button. In Eclipse, those buttons are the arrows shown in

H Print statements
‘When testing your code, you might ask yourselt whether the execution of the program has
reached a specific line of code, whether a variable changed its value as expected or whether a

decision statement has been evaluated to true or false. Including print statements into your
code to trace such changes is a useful method that would help you identify when exactly your

code stopped running as expected and give you an idea of what went wrong. The only
impediment might be that, once the debugging has occurred and the errors are fixed, you will

have to delete those print statements.

Affective skills: Demonstrate persistence and perseverance. Don't give up when you

(;TOK
Language and meaning
We use different programming languages to code, each with its own syntax and grammar rules.
English is not suitable to be used as a programming language because it is ambiguous and many
expressions can be interpreted differently based on the context in which they are used.
Analyse the following statements and identify the possible meanings of each of them:
B Peter and Anna are married.
B A salesman visited every house in the area.
B Look at that dog with one eye.
What are the essential features of a computer language? Why is there a need for a fixed vocabulary,
unambiguous meaning and consistent grammar and syntax?
