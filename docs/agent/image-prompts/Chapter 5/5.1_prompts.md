# 5.1 The Internet and the WWW - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: Internet vs World Wide Web (WWW)
- **Type**: Comparison Table / Venn Diagram
- **Description**: Clarifying the distinct difference between the infrastructure (Internet) and the service (WWW).
- **Prompt**: Create a comparison visual titled "Internet vs. World Wide Web".
  - **The Internet**:
    - Icon: A globe with connected nodes/wires.
    - Definition: "The physical infrastructure. A massive network of networks."
    - Key Features: "Hardware (Cables, Routers), TCP/IP Protocols, Global connectivity."
    - Analogy: "The Tracks and Signals of a railway system."
  - **The WWW**:
    - Icon: A web page or browser window.
    - Definition: "A service that runs ON the internet. A collection of web pages."
    - Key Features: "Software (Browsers), HTTP/HTTPS, HTML, URLs."
    - Analogy: "The Trains and Cargo moving on the tracks."
  - **Venn Diagram Overlap**: "Both are essential for modern browsing."

## Concept: Anatomy of a URL
- **Type**: Anatomy Diagram
- **Description**: Breaking down a Uniform Resource Locator into its components.
- **Prompt**: Create a detailed breakdown of the URL: `https://www.example.com/products/item1.html`.
  - **Protocol**: Label `https://`. Text: "Protocol. Rules for communication. 's' = Secure (Encrypted)."
  - **Domain Name**: Label `www.example.com`. Text: "Domain Name. The address of the web server."
  - **Path**: Label `/products/`. Text: "Path. The folder structure on the server."
  - **File Name**: Label `item1.html`. Text: "File Name. The specific resource being requested."
  - **Visual Style**: Use brackets to group the parts and callout boxes for explanations.

## Concept: HTTP vs HTTPS
- **Type**: Comparison Infographic
- **Description**: Visualizing the security difference between HTTP and HTTPS.
- **Prompt**: Create a side-by-side comparison of "HTTP vs HTTPS".
  - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**:
    - Icon: An open unlocked padlock.
    - Visual: Data packets moving as plain text (e.g., "Password123" visible).
    - Text: "Not Encrypted. Data can be intercepted and read. Faster but insecure."
  - **HTTPS (Secure)**:
    - Icon: A closed green padlock.
    - Visual: Data packets moving as scrambled code (e.g., "X7#b9@z").
    - Text: "Encrypted using SSL/TLS. Data is unreadable if intercepted. Essential for banking/shopping."
  - **Key Takeaway**: "Always look for the padlock icon when entering personal data."

## Concept: How a Web Browser Works
- **Type**: Process Flowchart
- **Description**: The steps a browser takes to display a page.
- **Prompt**: Create a 4-step flowchart titled "Function of a Web Browser".
  - **Step 1: Request**: User enters URL. Browser sends HTTP request to Web Server.
  - **Step 2: Retrieve**: Web Server sends back HTML code and resources (images, CSS).
  - **Step 3: Interpret**: Browser translates (renders) the HTML tags.
  - **Step 4: Display**: The formatted web page appears on the user's screen.
  - **Visuals**: Icons for User, Browser, Cloud/Server.

## Concept: Cookies (Session vs Persistent)
- **Type**: Comparison / Dual-Panel Visual
- **Description**: Explaining the two main types of cookies and their purposes.
- **Prompt**: Create a visual comparison of "Session Cookies vs. Persistent Cookies".
  - **Definition**: "Cookies: Small text files stored on your computer by a website."
  - **Session Cookies**:
    - Icon: A shopping cart or temporary RAM icon.
    - Text: "Temporary. Stored in RAM. Deleted when browser closes."
    - Use Case: "Keeping items in a shopping basket while you browse."
  - **Persistent Cookies**:
    - Icon: A hard drive or ID card.
    - Text: "Permanent. Stored on Hard Drive. Stays until expiry date or manually deleted."
    - Use Case: "Remembering login details ('Remember Me'), User preferences, Tracking user behavior."
