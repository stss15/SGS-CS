# 2.1 Data Transmission - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: Data Packet Structure
- **Type**: Anatomy Diagram
- **Description**: A detailed breakdown of a data packet's components.
- **Prompt**: Create a "cutaway" diagram of a Data Packet.
  - **Header (Front)**: Label "Header". Text: "Source IP, Dest IP, Sequence #, Packet Size".
  - **Payload (Middle)**: Label "Payload". Text: "Actual Data (approx 64KiB)".
  - **Trailer (End)**: Label "Trailer". Text: "End of Packet Marker, Error Check (CRC)".
  - **Style**: Technical, exploded view or segmented bar.

## Concept: Packet Switching
- **Type**: Network Map / Flow
- **Description**: Visualizing how packets travel independently across a network.
- **Prompt**: Create a network map showing "Packet Switching".
  - **Source (Computer A)**: Sending an image split into 3 packets (1, 2, 3).
  - **Network (Mesh)**: A web of Routers. Show Packet 1 taking Route X, Packet 2 taking Route Y, Packet 3 taking Route Z.
  - **Destination (Computer B)**: Packets arriving out of order (2, 3, 1) and being reassembled.
  - **Key Labels**: "Independent Routing", "Routers decide path", "Reassembly at destination".

## Concept: Transmission Modes
- **Type**: Analogy Visual
- **Description**: Using road traffic analogies to explain Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex.
- **Prompt**: Create a 3-panel analogy diagram.
  - **Panel 1: Simplex**: A one-way street. Cars moving left to right only. Label: "Simplex: One direction only (e.g., Keyboard to CPU)".
  - **Panel 2: Half-Duplex**: A road with roadworks/traffic lights. Cars wait for one side to pass before the other goes. Label: "Half-Duplex: Both directions, but not at same time (e.g., Walkie-Talkie)".
  - **Panel 3: Full-Duplex**: A dual carriageway / highway. Cars moving both ways simultaneously. Label: "Full-Duplex: Both directions simultaneously (e.g., Broadband)".

## Concept: Serial vs Parallel Transmission
- **Type**: Technical Comparison
- **Description**: Contrasting the physical wiring and bit flow of Serial and Parallel.
- **Prompt**: Create a split diagram.
  - **Top (Serial)**: One single wire. Bits `1 0 1 1` moving in single file. Text: "1 Bit at a time. 1 Wire. Long distance. Slower. No Skew."
  - **Bottom (Parallel)**: 8 wires running parallel. 8 bits moving together abreast. Text: "Multiple bits at a time. Multiple wires. Short distance. Faster. Risk of Skew."

## Concept: USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- **Type**: Connector Diagram
- **Description**: The pinout and benefits of USB.
- **Prompt**: Create a diagram of a USB Type-A connector face-on.
  - **Pins**: Label the 4 pins: "1. VCC (+5V)", "2. Data -", "3. Data +", "4. Ground".
  - **Info Box**: "Universal Serial Bus".
  - **Benefits List**: "Auto-detection", "Device Drivers loaded automatically", "Cannot be inserted incorrectly", "Industry Standard".
1. Power & Data in one cable. 2. Universal Standard. 3. Auto-detection (Plug & Play)". Professional textbook style.
