# 3.1 Computer Architecture - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: Von Neumann Architecture
- **Type**: Anatomy Diagram
- **Description**: A detailed, labeled diagram of the CPU and its connections.
- **Prompt**: Create a detailed "Anatomy of the CPU" diagram based on Von Neumann architecture.
  - **Central Unit**: A large block labeled "CPU (Central Processing Unit)".
  - **Internal Components**:
    - **Control Unit (CU)**: Label "Control Unit". Text: "Decodes instructions. Sends control signals. Manages data flow."
    - **ALU**: Label "Arithmetic & Logic Unit". Text: "Performs calculations (+, -, etc.) and logic checks (AND, OR, NOT)."
    - **Registers**: Small boxes labeled "PC (Program Counter)", "MAR (Memory Address Register)", "MDR (Memory Data Register)", "CIR (Current Instruction Register)", "ACC (Accumulator)".
  - **Buses**: Arrows connecting components.
    - **Address Bus**: Arrow from CPU to Memory (One way). Label: "Address Bus (Unidirectional)".
    - **Data Bus**: Double-headed arrow between CPU and Memory. Label: "Data Bus (Bidirectional)".
    - **Control Bus**: Double-headed arrow. Label: "Control Bus (Bidirectional)".
  - **Memory**: A block labeled "Primary Memory (RAM)". Show "Address" and "Content" columns.

## Concept: Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
- **Type**: Flowchart / Cycle Diagram
- **Description**: A step-by-step visual of the F-D-E cycle with register details.
- **Prompt**: Create a circular cycle diagram for the "Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle".
  - **Step 1: Fetch**:
    - Text: "1. PC holds address of next instruction."
    - Text: "2. Address copied to MAR."
    - Text: "3. Instruction at address fetched to MDR."
    - Text: "4. Instruction copied to CIR."
    - Text: "5. PC incremented by 1."
  - **Step 2: Decode**:
    - Text: "CU decodes the instruction in the CIR."
  - **Step 3: Execute**:
    - Text: "Instruction is carried out (e.g., calculation in ALU, data moved)."
  - **Visuals**: Use arrows to show the flow. Add small icons for CPU and Memory.

## Concept: Cores, Cache, and Clock Speed
- **Type**: Infographic
- **Description**: Explaining factors affecting CPU performance.
- **Prompt**: Create a 3-panel performance infographic.
  - **Panel 1: Clock Speed**: Image of a clock or speedometer. Text: "Clock Speed (GHz). Cycles per second. Higher speed = More instructions processed per second. Overclocking = Risk of overheating."
  - **Panel 2: Cores**: Image of a CPU split into 4 parts. Text: "Multi-Core (Dual/Quad). Parallel processing. More cores = Can run multiple instructions simultaneously (if software allows)."
  - **Panel 3: Cache**: Image of a small fast storage box near CPU. Text: "Cache Memory. Super-fast RAM inside CPU. Stores frequently used instructions. Larger cache = Less time waiting for RAM."

## Concept: Instruction Set
- **Type**: Code/Logic Visual
- **Description**: Visualizing Opcode and Operand.
- **Prompt**: Create a visual breakdown of a "Machine Code Instruction".
  - **Visual**: A binary block `1011 0011`.
  - **Split**: Divide it into two parts.
  - **Part 1 (Opcode)**: Label `1011` as "Opcode". Text: "Operation Code. Tells CPU *what* to do (e.g., ADD, LOAD, JUMP)."
  - **Part 2 (Operand)**: Label `0011` as "Operand". Text: "The Data or Address. Tells CPU *what* to apply the operation to."
  - **Example**: Text box: "Assembly: LDA 15 (Load contents of address 15)."

## Concept: Embedded Systems
- **Type**: System Diagram
- **Description**: Showing the input-process-output nature of embedded systems.
- **Prompt**: Create a diagram for an "Embedded System (e.g., Washing Machine)".
  - **Input**: Icons for "Sensors". Label: "Water Level, Temperature, Door Lock".
  - **Process**: Central chip icon. Label: "Microcontroller". Text: "Dedicated task. Real-time processing. Firmware."
  - **Output**: Icons for "Actuators". Label: "Motor (Spin), Heater (Heat water), Pump (Drain)".
  - **Definition Box**: "Embedded System: A computer system built into a larger device. Dedicated purpose. Reliable. Low power."
