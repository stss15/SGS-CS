# 6.3 Artificial Intelligence - Revision Artifact Prompts

## Concept: Categories of AI
- **Type**: Pyramid / Levels Diagram
- **Description**: The hierarchy of Artificial Intelligence capability.
- **Prompt**: Create a 3-level pyramid for "Types of AI".
  - **Base (Narrow AI)**:
    - Text: "Narrow AI. Designed for ONE specific task."
    - Examples: "Chess computer, Siri, Spam filter."
    - Status: "Current Technology."
  - **Middle (General AI)**:
    - Text: "General AI. Can perform ANY intellectual task a human can."
    - Status: "Future Goal."
  - **Top (Strong AI)**:
    - Text: "Strong AI / Superintelligence. Surpasses human intelligence."
    - Status: "Theoretical."

## Concept: Expert System Architecture
- **Type**: System Block Diagram
- **Description**: The components of an Expert System.
- **Prompt**: Create a block diagram for an "Expert System Structure".
  - **User**: Stick figure on the left.
  - **User Interface**: Box. Arrow between User and UI. Text: "Allows query input and answer output."
  - **Inference Engine**: Central Box. Text: "The 'Brain'. Applies rules to facts to find answers."
  - **Knowledge Base**: Box connected to Inference Engine. Text: "Database of Facts (Objects & Attributes)."
  - **Rules Base**: Box connected to Inference Engine. Text: "Logic Rules (IF-THEN statements)."
  - **Explanation System**: Box connected to UI. Text: "Explains HOW the conclusion was reached."

## Concept: Machine Learning Process
- **Type**: Flowchart
- **Description**: How machines learn from data.
- **Prompt**: Create a flowchart for "How Machine Learning Works".
  - **Step 1: Data Collection**: Icon of documents/images. Text: "Gather huge amounts of data (Training Data)."
  - **Step 2: Training**: Icon of a gear/brain. Text: "Algorithm looks for patterns and rules in the data."
  - **Step 3: Model**: Icon of a blueprint. Text: "A model is created based on the patterns."
  - **Step 4: Prediction**: New Data enters -> Model -> Prediction/Decision comes out.
  - **Feedback**: Arrow from Prediction back to Training. Text: "System learns from mistakes to improve accuracy."

## Concept: AI vs Machine Learning
- **Type**: Venn Diagram / Subset Visual
- **Description**: Clarifying the relationship between AI and ML.
- **Prompt**: Create a nested circle diagram (Subset).
  - **Outer Circle**: Label "Artificial Intelligence (AI)".
    - Text: "The broad concept of machines acting smartly."
  - **Inner Circle**: Label "Machine Learning (ML)".
    - Text: "A subset of AI. Machines learning from data without being explicitly programmed for every rule."
  - **Deep Learning**: (Optional smaller circle inside ML). Label "Deep Learning (Neural Networks)."
