lesson:
  title: "Topic 1: Data Representation"
  subtitle: "How computers store and send data"
  retrieval:
    prompt: "Retrieval Practice"
    questions:
      - { question: "Which number system do computers use?", answer: "Binary (base 2)" }
      - { question: "8 bits is called?", answer: "A byte" }
      - { question: "What is ASCII used for?", answer: "Character encoding" }
      - { question: "Define bit", answer: "Smallest unit: 0 or 1" }
      - { question: "Name a compression type", answer: "Lossy or Lossless" }
  objectives:
    - "Recall key data representation units (bit, nibble, byte, KB, MB)."
    - "Explain how binary represents numbers and text."
    - "Discuss why compression is needed and compare lossy vs lossless."
  contentBlocks:
    - type: key-terms
      title: Key Terms
      items:
        - { term: "Bit", definition: "A single 0 or 1." }
        - { term: "Nibble", definition: "4 bits." }
        - { term: "Byte", definition: "8 bits." }
        - { term: "ASCII", definition: "7/8-bit code mapping numbers to characters." }
        - { term: "Unicode", definition: "Variable-length code supporting many scripts." }
    - type: concept
      title: "Why Binary?"
      prompt: "Pose to students: Why not base 10 inside a computer?"
      bullets:
        - "Hardware is built from two stable states (on/off)."
        - "Noise-resistant compared to many voltage levels."
        - "Logical operations map cleanly to binary (AND/OR/NOT)."
    - type: discussion
      title: "Check Your Intuition"
      question: "Does Unicode replace ASCII?"
      points:
        - "ASCII is still a subset (first 128/256 codes)."
        - "Unicode expands to cover global scripts and emoji."
        - "Storage/transmission impact: UTF-8 vs UTF-16 length differences."
    - type: compare
      title: "Lossy vs Lossless"
      leftTitle: "Lossy"
      rightTitle: "Lossless"
      leftPoints:
        - "Removes data permanently."
        - "Smaller files; not reversible."
        - "Good for photos/music (JPEG/MP3)."
      rightPoints:
        - "No data lost; reversible."
        - "Larger files."
        - "Used for text/executables (ZIP/PNG)."
    - type: steps
      title: "Binary to Denary Walkthrough"
      steps:
        - "Write place values (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)."
        - "Mark 1s where bits are set."
        - "Sum the place values."
        - "Check with calculator / pair check."
    - type: qna
      question: "Where can compression go wrong?"
      answers:
        - "Lossy compression can remove detail the user cares about."
        - "Repeated lossy saves degrade quality over time."
        - "Wrong format choice (JPEG for line art) causes artifacts."
