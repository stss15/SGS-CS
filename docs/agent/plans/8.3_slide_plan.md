# 8.3 File Handling - Slide Plan

## 1. Title Slide
- **Title**: 8.3 File Handling
- **Subtitle**: Topic 8: Programming | Persistent Data

## 2. Retrieval Practice
- **Slide Type**: Retrieval Practice
- **Question**: Recall Arrays (8.2)
- **Content**:
    1.  How do you declare an array of 10 integers? (`ARRAY[1:10] OF INTEGER`)
    2.  What does a 2D array look like? (A table/grid)
    3.  What algorithm swaps adjacent items to order a list? (Bubble Sort)

## 3. The Hook
- **Slide Type**: The Hook
- **Question**: What happens when you turn the computer off?
- **Scenario**: You spend hours writing a document. You turn off the PC without saving. What happens?
- **Concept**: RAM is volatile (temporary). Files are permanent (stored on HDD/SSD).
- **Key Idea**: File handling allows programs to save data so it's there next time.

## 4. Reading & Writing
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: What can we do with files?
- **Analogy**: A notebook. You can **Read** what's written, or **Write** something new.
- **Operations**:
    -   **Open**: Must open a file before using it.
    -   **Read**: Get data from file.
    -   **Write**: Put data into file.
    -   **Close**: Must close file after use (to save changes and free resources).

## 5. Writing to a File
- **Slide Type**: Process
- **Question**: How do we save data?
- **Steps**:
    1.  `OPEN "MyFile.txt" FOR WRITE`
    2.  `WRITEFILE "Hello World"`
    3.  `CLOSEFILE("MyFile.txt")`
- **Note**: Opening for WRITE usually creates a new file or overwrites the existing one.

## 6. Reading from a File
- **Slide Type**: Process
- **Question**: How do we load data?
- **Steps**:
    1.  `OPEN "MyFile.txt" FOR READ`
    2.  `READFILE LineOfText`
    3.  `CLOSEFILE("MyFile.txt")`
- **Looping**: Often use a loop to read line by line until End of File (EOF).

## 7. Example: Saving High Scores
- **Slide Type**: Vertical Deep Dive
- **Question**: A real-world example?
- **Scenario**: A game needs to save the top score.
- **Code**:
    ```
    OUTPUT "Enter High Score"
    INPUT Score
    OPEN "Scores.txt" FOR WRITE
    WRITEFILE Score
    CLOSEFILE("Scores.txt")
    ```

## 8. True or False
- **Slide Type**: Plenary
- **Questions**:
    1.  Data in RAM is lost when power is off. (True)
    2.  You can read from a file without opening it. (False)
    3.  `WRITEFILE` adds text to the end of a file. (False - usually overwrites, APPEND is different but syllabus says WRITE). *Correction*: Syllabus implies WRITE creates/overwrites.
