# Slide Plan: 3.1 Computer Architecture

## Source Material
- **File:** `3.1.txt`
- **Topic:** Computer Architecture (Von Neumann, CPU, FDE Cycle, Performance, Embedded Systems)

## Slide Structure

### 1. Title Slide
- **Main Title:** 3.1 Computer Architecture
- **Sub-Title:** Topic 3: Hardware

### 2. The Big Question (Hook)
- **Concept:** The Brain of the Machine.
- **Question:** How does a pile of metal and silicon actually "think"?
- **Visual:** Brain icon vs CPU icon.
- **Key Idea:** The CPU processes instructions one by one, incredibly fast.

### 3. The CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- **Slide:** Definition and Role.
- **Content:**
    - "The Brain".
    - Responsible for execution of instructions.
    - Microprocessor: CPU on a single chip.
- **Visual:** Icon of a chip.

### 4. Von Neumann Architecture
- **Slide:** The Stored Program Concept.
- **Content:**
    - Programs and data stored in the SAME memory.
    - Instructions executed sequentially.
- **Deep Dive (Vertical):** The Components.
    - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Does the maths (+, -) and logic (AND, OR).
    - **CU (Control Unit):** The conductor. Decodes instructions, sends signals.
    - **Registers:** Tiny, super-fast storage spots (PC, MAR, MDR, CIR, ACC).
    - **Buses:** The wires (Address, Data, Control).

### 5. The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
- **Slide:** The Heartbeat.
- **Content:**
    - **Fetch:** Get instruction from memory.
    - **Decode:** Figure out what it means.
    - **Execute:** Do it.
- **Deep Dive (Vertical):** Step-by-Step (The Register Dance).
    1.  PC holds address of next instruction.
    2.  PC -> MAR.
    3.  MAR -> Memory -> MDR.
    4.  MDR -> CIR.
    5.  PC + 1.
    6.  Decode (in CU).
    7.  Execute (ALU/ACC etc).

### 6. CPU Performance
- **Slide:** Need for Speed.
- **Content:**
    - **Clock Speed:** Hz (Cycles per second). More = Faster.
    - **Cores:** More brains. Dual, Quad. (Note: overhead of communication).
    - **Cache:** Super fast memory ON the CPU. Stores frequently used data.
- **Visual:** Speedometer, Multiple brains icons.

### 7. Embedded Systems
- **Slide:** Computers in Disguise.
- **Content:**
    - Computer system built INTO a device.
    - Dedicated function (one job).
    - Examples: Washing machine, Car engine, Microwave.
- **Deep Dive (Vertical):** Pros & Cons.
    - **Pros:** Reliable, cheap, low power.
    - **Cons:** Hard to upgrade, hard to fix.

### 8. Plenary: True or False?
- **Slide:** Misconception Check.
- **Questions:**
    1.  "Data and programs are stored in separate memories in Von Neumann architecture." (False)
    2.  "The ALU controls the flow of data." (False - that's the CU)
    3.  "An embedded system is a general-purpose computer." (False)
    4.  "More cores always means double the speed." (False)

## Interactive Elements
- **Fragments:** For revealing bullet points.
- **R-Stack:** For the FDE cycle steps? Or maybe just vertical slides. Vertical slides are better for the "Deep Dive" steps.
- **Icons:** FontAwesome for CPU, Memory, Bus, etc.
