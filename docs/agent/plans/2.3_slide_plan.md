# Slide Plan: 2.3 Encryption

**Goal:** Explain the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on the "Key" analogy.

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 2.3 Encryption
  - Sub-title: Topic 2: Data Transmission
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** How do you send a secret message through a crowd?
  - **Visual:** Passing a note in class vs Using a code.
  - **Key Idea:** Encryption doesn't hide the message; it makes it unreadable.

## 3. Symmetric Encryption
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Single Key
  - **Concept:** One key to Lock (Encrypt) and the SAME key to Unlock (Decrypt).
  - **Problem:** How do you send the key safely? (Key Exchange Problem).

## 4. Asymmetric Encryption
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Two Keys
  - **Concept:**
    - **Public Key:** Everyone has it. Used to **Encrypt**.
    - **Private Key:** Only you have it. Used to **Decrypt**.
  - **Analogy:** Anyone can drop a letter in your mailbox (Public), but only you have the key to open it (Private).

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: The Process
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Sending):**
  - Sender looks up Receiver's Public Key.
  - Encrypts message.
- **Slide 2 (Receiving):**
  - Receiver uses their Private Key.
  - Decrypts message.
  - **Security:** Even if the sender intercepts the message, they can't decrypt it.

## 5. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "Symmetric encryption uses two different keys."
  - **Answer:** False. It uses the same key.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "In Asymmetric encryption, you share your Private Key."
  - **Answer:** False! Never share the Private Key. Share the Public Key.
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "Encryption prevents data from being intercepted."
  - **Answer:** False. It prevents it from being *understood*.
