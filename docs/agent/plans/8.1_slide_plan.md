# 8.1 Programming Concepts - Slide Plan

## 1. Title Slide
- **Title**: 8.1 Programming Concepts
- **Subtitle**: Topic 8: Programming | Building Blocks of Code

## 2. Retrieval Practice
- **Slide Type**: Retrieval Practice
- **Question**: Recall Algorithm Design (Topic 7)
- **Content**:
    1.  What is the difference between a variable and a constant? (Preview/Recall)
    2.  What shape represents an Input/Output in a flowchart?
    3.  What are the three basic programming constructs? (Sequence, Selection, Iteration)

## 3. The Hook
- **Slide Type**: The Hook
- **Question**: How does a computer know what to do?
- **Scenario**: Imagine giving instructions to a robot chef. If you say "Cook", it's confused. You need to say "Take egg. Crack egg. Fry egg."
- **Concept**: Programming is about giving precise, step-by-step instructions (algorithms) that a computer can execute.
- **Key Idea**: Code is the language we use to translate human ideas into computer actions.

## 4. Variables & Constants
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do programs remember information?
- **Analogy**: A **Variable** is like a whiteboard (you can write on it, wipe it, and write something new). A **Constant** is like a stone carving (once written, it cannot be changed).
- **Definition**:
    -   **Variable**: A named data store that contains a value that *can* change during execution.
    -   **Constant**: A named data store that contains a value that *cannot* change during execution.
- **Deep Dive**: Declaration & Assignment

## 5. Deep Dive: Declaration
- **Slide Type**: Vertical Deep Dive
- **Question**: How do we create them?
- **Content**:
    -   **Pseudocode**:
        -   `DECLARE Score : INTEGER`
        -   `CONSTANT Pi = 3.142`
    -   **Assignment**: `Score ← 10`
    -   **Key Point**: Use meaningful names (e.g., `StudentName` not `x`).

## 6. Data Types
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: What kind of data are we storing?
- **Analogy**: Different shaped holes for different shaped pegs. You can't put a name (String) into a calculator (Integer) slot.
- **Content**:
    -   **Integer**: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
    -   **Real**: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
    -   **Char**: Single character (e.g., 'A', '$').
    -   **String**: Text (e.g., "Hello World").
    -   **Boolean**: True/False.

## 7. Input & Output
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we talk to the program?
- **Content**:
    -   **Input**: Getting data *into* the program (e.g., Keyboard).
        -   `INPUT Name`
    -   **Output**: Sending data *out* of the program (e.g., Screen).
        -   `OUTPUT "Hello ", Name`
- **Interaction**: Show a simple dialogue: Computer asks "Name?", User types "Bob", Computer says "Hello Bob".

## 8. The Three Constructs
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we control the flow?
- **Content**:
    1.  **Sequence**: Instructions happen one after another.
    2.  **Selection**: Making choices (IF, CASE).
    3.  **Iteration**: Repeating steps (Loops).

## 9. Selection: IF Statements
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do the program make decisions?
- **Analogy**: A fork in the road. If left, go to beach. If right, go to mountains.
- **Content**:
    -   `IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF`
    -   Example:
        ```
        IF Age >= 18 THEN
            OUTPUT "Adult"
        ELSE
            OUTPUT "Child"
        ENDIF
        ```

## 10. Selection: CASE Statements
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: What if there are many choices?
- **Analogy**: A vending machine menu. Press 1 for Coke, 2 for Pepsi, 3 for Water.
- **Content**:
    -   `CASE OF... OTHERWISE... ENDCASE`
    -   Example:
        ```
        CASE OF Grade
            "A" : OUTPUT "Excellent"
            "B" : OUTPUT "Good"
            OTHERWISE OUTPUT "Keep trying"
        ENDCASE
        ```

## 11. Iteration: Count-Controlled (FOR)
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we repeat something a specific number of times?
- **Analogy**: Doing 10 pushups. You count 1, 2, 3... 10.
- **Content**:
    -   `FOR... TO... NEXT`
    -   Example:
        ```
        FOR i ← 1 TO 10
            OUTPUT i
        NEXT i
        ```

## 12. Iteration: Pre-Condition (WHILE)
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we repeat while a condition is true?
- **Analogy**: "While it is raining, keep your umbrella up." (Check *before* you go out).
- **Content**:
    -   `WHILE... DO... ENDWHILE`
    -   Example:
        ```
        WHILE Password <> "Secret" DO
            INPUT Password
        ENDWHILE
        ```

## 13. Iteration: Post-Condition (REPEAT)
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we repeat until a condition is true?
- **Analogy**: "Repeat washing dishes until none are left." (Do at least one wash).
- **Content**:
    -   `REPEAT... UNTIL`
    -   Example:
        ```
        REPEAT
            INPUT Number
        UNTIL Number > 10
        ```

## 14. String Handling
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we manipulate text?
- **Content**:
    -   **Length**: `LENGTH("Hello")` -> 5
    -   **Substring**: `SUBSTRING("Hello", 1, 2)` -> "He"
    -   **Upper/Lower**: `UCASE("a")` -> "A"

## 15. Subroutines (Procedures & Functions)
- **Slide Type**: Concept
- **Question**: How do we organise big programs?
- **Analogy**: A recipe. "Make Sauce" is a sub-task. You don't write the sauce instructions every time, you just say "Make Sauce".
- **Content**:
    -   **Procedure**: Does a job, returns nothing.
    -   **Function**: Does a job, **returns a value**.
    -   **Parameters**: Data passed into them.

## 16. True or False
- **Slide Type**: Plenary
- **Questions**:
    1.  A constant's value can change during the program. (False)
    2.  A WHILE loop always runs at least once. (False - it checks first)
    3.  `x ← 5` is an assignment statement. (True)
