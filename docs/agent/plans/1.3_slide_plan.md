# Slide Plan: 1.3 Data Storage and Compression

**Goal:** Explain data measurement units (bits to TiB), calculate file sizes, and understand the need for and types of compression (Lossy vs Lossless).

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on the "Reality of Limits" (Storage isn't infinite) and the "Trade-offs" of compression.

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 1.3 Data Storage & Compression
  - Sub-title: Topic 1: Data Representation | Fitting it all in
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Why does a 1TB drive not actually hold 1TB?
  - **Visual:** A hard drive label vs the computer screen showing "931 GB".
  - **Key Idea:** The difference between Marketing (Decimal) and Computing (Binary).

## 3. Measuring Data
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Units of Storage
  - **Hierarchy:** Bit -> Nibble (4) -> Byte (8).
  - **Prefixes:**
    - Decimal (k, M, G, T): Powers of 10 (1000). Used by humans/sales.
    - Binary (Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti): Powers of 2 (1024). Used by OS/RAM.

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: The Conversion
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (The Rule):**
  - 1 KiB = 1024 Bytes.
  - 1 MiB = 1024 KiB.
  - Always multiply/divide by 1024, not 1000.
- **Slide 2 (Example):**
  - How many bits in 2 KiB?
  - 2 * 1024 (Bytes) * 8 (Bits) = 16,384 bits.

## 4. Calculating File Sizes (Recap & Practice)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Size Calculations
  - **Note:** We learned the formulas in 1.2. Now we practice the units.
  - **Challenge:** Calculate and convert to the appropriate unit (e.g., MiB).

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Worked Examples
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Image):**
  - 800x600, 24-bit colour. Result in MiB.
  - (800*600*24) / 8 / 1024 / 1024 ≈ 1.37 MiB.
- **Slide 2 (Sound):**
  - 44.1kHz, 16-bit, Stereo, 3 mins. Result in MiB.
  - (44100 * 16 * 2 * 180) / 8 / 1024 / 1024 ≈ 30.3 MiB.

## 5. Compression
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Why Compress?
  - **Reasons:**
    - Save Storage Space.
    - Faster Transmission (Streaming, Downloading).
  - **The Trade-off:** Quality vs Size.

### 5.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Lossy vs Lossless
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Lossy):**
  - **Concept:** Permanently deletes "unnecessary" data.
  - **Use:** Images (JPG), Audio (MP3), Video.
  - **Effect:** Quality drops, size drops significantly. Can't go back.
- **Slide 2 (Lossless):**
  - **Concept:** Shrinks file without losing any data. Rearranges/Encodes efficiently.
  - **Use:** Text, Code, High-end Audio (FLAC), ZIP files.
  - **Effect:** Quality stays 100%, size drops moderately. Original can be restored perfectly.

## 6. How Compression Works (Basics)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Under the Hood
  - **Lossy:** Removes sounds humans can't hear (Psychoacoustics) or similar colours.
  - **Lossless (RLE):** Run Length Encoding.
    - "AAAAA" -> "5A".
    - Great for simple bitmaps with blocks of colour.

## 7. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "1 KB is exactly the same as 1 KiB."
  - **Answer:** False. 1 KB = 1000 bytes. 1 KiB = 1024 bytes.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "Lossy compression allows you to get the original file back perfectly."
  - **Answer:** False. Data is permanently removed. You need Lossless for that.
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "You should use Lossy compression for a text document."
  - **Answer:** False! Imagine losing random letters. Text needs Lossless.
- **Slide 5 (Q4):** "RLE works best on photos with lots of detail."
  - **Answer:** False. It works best on simple images with long "runs" of the same colour.
