# Slide Plan: 6.3 Artificial Intelligence

**Goal:** Define AI, distinguish between Narrow, General, and Strong AI, explain Expert Systems and Machine Learning, and discuss their applications.

**Pedagogy:** Question First. Focus on "Simulation" vs "Thinking" and the difference between "Rules" (Expert Systems) and "Data" (Machine Learning).

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 6.3 Artificial Intelligence
  - Sub-title: Topic 6: Automated & Emerging Technologies
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Can a computer "think"?
  - **Visual:** The Turing Test. A human chatting with a screen.
  - **Key Idea:** AI is the **simulation** of intelligent human behaviour. It mimics thinking.

## 3. Categories of AI
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** How smart is it?
  - **Narrow AI:** Good at ONE thing (Chess, Spam filter). Superior to humans in that niche.
  - **General AI:** Good at EVERYTHING (Like a human). Not yet achieved.
  - **Strong AI:** Superior to humans in everything. (Sci-Fi).

## 4. Expert Systems (Old School AI)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Expert Systems
  - **Definition:** A system that mimics the decision-making of a human expert.
  - **Uses:** Medical diagnosis, Car diagnostics, Mineral prospecting.

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: How it Works
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (The Components):**
  - **Knowledge Base:** Database of facts.
  - **Rules Base:** IF-THEN logic.
  - **Inference Engine:** The "Brain" that applies rules to facts.
  - **User Interface:** The questions asked to the user.
- **Slide 2 (Example):**
  - **User:** "I have a fever and spots."
  - **Inference Engine:** Checks Rules Base. "IF fever AND spots THEN Measles."
  - **Output:** "Diagnosis: Measles (90% probability)."

## 5. Machine Learning (New School AI)
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Machine Learning
  - **Question:** How does Netflix know what you like?
  - **Definition:** Algorithms that **learn** from data rather than being explicitly programmed with rules.
  - **Key Difference:**
    - Expert System: Humans write the rules.
    - Machine Learning: The computer finds the rules by looking at data.

### 5.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Examples
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Spam Filters):**
  - Feed it 10,000 spam emails and 10,000 good emails.
  - It "learns" that "Winner!" usually means spam.
- **Slide 2 (Image Recognition):**
  - Feed it 1 million cat photos.
  - It learns the shape of ears, whiskers, etc.
- **Slide 3 (Recommendation Engines):**
  - "People who bought X also bought Y."
  - Collaborative filtering.

## 6. AI in the Real World
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Applications
  - **List:**
    - **Transport:** Self-driving cars (Pattern recognition).
    - **Finance:** Fraud detection (Spotting unusual spending).
    - **Smart Homes:** Voice assistants (Natural Language Processing).

## 7. Plenary: True or False?
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1 (Intro):** Misconception Check.
- **Slide 2 (Q1):** "Narrow AI can perform any task a human can do."
  - **Answer:** False. It is only good at **one** specific task.
- **Slide 3 (Q2):** "In an Expert System, the Inference Engine stores the facts."
  - **Answer:** False. The **Knowledge Base** stores facts. The Inference Engine does the reasoning.
- **Slide 4 (Q3):** "Machine Learning requires a human to write every single rule."
  - **Answer:** False. That's traditional programming. ML learns rules from **data**.
- **Slide 5 (Q4):** "Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning."
  - **Answer:** True. (It uses neural networks to mimic the brain).
