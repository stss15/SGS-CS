# Slide Plan: 7.2 Computer Systems, Sub-systems and Decomposition

**Goal:** Show how any system can be broken into sub-systems, map every problem into Inputs/Processes/Outputs/Storage, and introduce the design notations (Structure Diagrams, Flowcharts, Pseudocode) with correct IGCSE conventions.

**Pedagogy:** Build → Label → Practise. Start with a real system, strip it down visually, then formalise with symbols and pseudocode patterns. Every new structure comes with a 1-based worked example.

## 1. Title Slide
- **Type:** Title
- **Content:**
  - Main Title: 7.2 Computer Systems & Decomposition
  - Sub-title: Topic 7: Algorithm Design and Problem Solving
- **Notes:** Standard title layout.

## 2. Hook / Big Question
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Question:** Why can hundreds of programmers work on the same app?
  - **Visual:** A skyscraper cutaway showing floors vs a single empty shell.
  - **Key Idea:** Decomposition lets teams build small pieces that fit.

## 3. Systems and Sub-systems
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Top-Down Design (Stepwise Refinement)
  - **Message:** A system is software + data + hardware + comms + people. Each sub-system is broken until it does one action.
  - **Visual:** Structure diagram (tree) with 3 levels.

### 3.1 Vertical Deep Dive: IPO + Storage
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (The 4 Components):**
  - Inputs, Processes, Outputs, Storage.
  - **Mini-task:** Classify “Alarm App” features into IPO+S.
- **Slide 2 (Student Activity):**
  - Choose another daily system (e.g., online shopping). Learners list IPO+S.

### 3.2 Vertical Deep Dive: Structure Diagrams
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Rules):**
  - One action per box, branches show sub-systems, read left-to-right then top-to-bottom.
- **Slide 2 (Alarm App Example):**
  - Alarm App → Set Alarm | Check Time Loop | Sound Alarm.
  - Further split “Check Time Loop” into `Get Time`, `Compare`, `Snooze`.

## 4. Design Notations Toolkit
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Three Ways to Describe a Solution
  - Structure Diagrams (hierarchy), Flowcharts (visual flow), Pseudocode (structured English).

### 4.1 Vertical Deep Dive: Flowcharts
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Standard Symbols):**
  - Terminator (Start/Stop), Process (Rectangle), Input/Output (Parallelogram), Decision (Diamond), Flow lines (arrows).
- **Slide 2 (Mini Flowchart Walkthrough):**
  - Ticket discount example: input N, validate 1–25, decide discount bands, calculate cost, output.
  - Label Yes/No clearly.

### 4.2 Vertical Deep Dive: Pseudocode Conventions
- **Type:** Vertical Stack
- **Slide 1 (Syntax & Style):**
  - Keywords in CAPS; assignment uses `<-`; arrays start at index 1; indent 2 spaces in IF/loops; meaningful names.
- **Slide 2 (Inputs/Outputs/Assignment):**
  - `INPUT StudentName`, `OUTPUT "Hello"`, `Total <- Total + Mark`.
- **Slide 3 (Selection):**
  - `IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF` and `CASE OF ... OTHERWISE ... ENDCASE` (menu example for choices 1–4).
- **Slide 4 (Iteration):**
  - Count-controlled: `FOR i <- 1 TO 10 ... NEXT i`.
  - Post-condition: `REPEAT ... UNTIL Mark = -1` (runs at least once).
  - Pre-condition: `WHILE Mark <> -1 DO ... ENDWHILE` (might not run).

## 5. Guided Build: From Words to Design
- **Type:** Concept (Horizontal)
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** Turn a Brief into Three Views
  - Given text: “Alarm rings at set time, snooze for 5 minutes, stop on Off.”
  - Learners sketch IPO+S, a small structure diagram, and write 5–6 lines of pseudocode for the time check (1-based indices if an array is used).

## 6. Plenary: Match & Apply
- **Type:** Quiz (Vertical Stack)
- **Slide 1:** Which symbol shows a decision? **Answer:** Diamond.
- **Slide 2:** Which loop always runs at least once? **Answer:** `REPEAT ... UNTIL`.
- **Slide 3:** In IGCSE pseudocode, what is the first position of `StudentMark`? **Answer:** `StudentMark[1]`.
- **Slide 4:** Which notation best shows hierarchy? **Answer:** Structure diagram.
