# 3.1 Computer Architecture Assessment Plan

## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 3.1 using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: CPU Components (Matching)
**Concept**: Functions of main CPU components.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Control Unit (CU) -> Decodes instructions and controls timing
    -   Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) -> Performs calculations and logical operations
    -   Registers -> Small, high-speed memory locations within the CPU
    -   System Clock -> Synchronises all computer operations
    -   Cache -> Stores frequently used data for faster access

### Q2: Registers (Matching)
**Concept**: Purpose of specific registers.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Program Counter (PC) -> Stores the address of the *next* instruction
    -   Memory Address Register (MAR) -> Stores the address of the location to be read/written
    -   Memory Data Register (MDR) -> Stores data fetched from or waiting to be sent to memory
    -   Current Instruction Register (CIR) -> Stores the instruction currently being decoded/executed
    -   Accumulator (ACC) -> Stores the results of calculations from the ALU

### Q3: System Buses (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Characteristics of the three system buses.
-   **Text**:
    -   The (Address Bus) carries memory addresses from the CPU to memory. It is (unidirectional).
    -   The (Data Bus) carries data and instructions between the CPU and memory. It is (bidirectional).
    -   The (Control Bus) carries control signals to coordinate components. It is (bidirectional).
    -   As bus width increases, the amount of data that can be transferred (increases).

### Q4: Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle (Ordering)
**Concept**: The sequence of steps in the FDE cycle.
-   **Order**:
    1.  PC contains address of next instruction
    2.  Address is copied from PC to MAR
    3.  Instruction at address in MAR is copied to MDR
    4.  Instruction in MDR is copied to CIR
    5.  PC is incremented
    6.  Instruction is decoded and executed

### Q5: CPU Performance (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Factors affecting performance.
-   **Buckets**: Improves Performance, Does Not Necessarily Improve Performance
-   **Items**:
    -   Increasing clock speed (Improves Performance)
    -   Increasing bus width (Improves Performance)
    -   Adding more cores (Improves Performance)
    -   Increasing cache size (Improves Performance)
    -   Using a larger monitor (Does Not Necessarily Improve Performance)
    -   Changing the case colour (Does Not Necessarily Improve Performance)

### Q6: Embedded Systems (True/False Drag)
**Concept**: Characteristics and examples of embedded systems.
-   **True**:
    -   Designed for a specific task.
    -   Often have limited resources (RAM/ROM).
    -   Found in washing machines and cars.
    -   Firmware is difficult to upgrade.
-   **False**:
    -   General-purpose computers like laptops.
    -   Always have a keyboard and mouse.
    -   Can easily run any software application.
    -   Always use a quad-core processor.
