## Question Design

### Q1: Algorithm Types (Matching)
**Concept**: Identifying standard algorithms.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Totalling -> Adding values to a running total
    -   Counting -> Incrementing a counter for each occurrence
    -   Linear Search -> Checking each item in a list sequentially
    -   Bubble Sort -> Swapping adjacent items to order a list

### Q2: Totalling vs Counting (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Distinguishing between these two fundamental operations.
-   **Buckets**: Totalling, Counting
-   **Items**:
    -   `Total <- Total + Mark` (Totalling)
    -   `Sum <- Sum + Number` (Totalling)
    -   `Count <- Count + 1` (Counting)
    -   `Passes <- Passes + 1` (Counting)
    -   Keeping track of total sales (Totalling)
    -   Tracking number of customers (Counting)

### Q3: Linear Search Logic (Ordering)
**Concept**: Steps in a linear search.
-   **Order**:
    1.  INPUT ValueToFind
    2.  FOR Index <- 1 TO Length
    3.  IF List[Index] = ValueToFind THEN
    4.  OUTPUT "Found"
    5.  ENDIF
    6.  NEXT Index

### Q4: Bubble Sort Logic (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: How bubble sort works.
-   **Question**: In a Bubble Sort, what happens if two adjacent items are in the wrong order?
-   **Options**:
    -   They are swapped (Correct)
    -   They are deleted
    -   The algorithm stops
    -   They are moved to a new list

### Q5: Algorithm Purpose (Drag & Drop)
**Concept**: Identifying the purpose of code snippets.
-   **Buckets**: Maximum, Minimum, Average
-   **Items**:
    -   `IF Mark > Max THEN Max <- Mark` (Maximum)
    -   `IF Mark < Min THEN Min <- Mark` (Minimum)
    -   `Avg <- Total / Count` (Average)
