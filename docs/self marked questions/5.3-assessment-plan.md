## Question Design

### Q1: Malware Types (Matching)
**Concept**: Identifying different types of malicious software.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Virus -> Replicates by attaching to a host program
    -   Worm -> Standalone malware that self-replicates across networks
    -   Trojan Horse -> Disguised as legitimate software
    -   Spyware -> Monitors user activity and key presses
    -   Ransomware -> Encrypts data and demands payment
    -   Adware -> Floods user with unwanted pop-up ads

### Q2: Phishing vs Pharming (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Distinguishing between these two common attacks.
-   **Buckets**: Phishing, Pharming
-   **Items**:
    -   Sent via email (Phishing)
    -   Requires user to click a link (Phishing)
    -   "Dear Customer" generic greeting (Phishing)
    -   Malicious code on web server/computer (Pharming)
    -   Redirects to fake site automatically (Pharming)
    -   DNS cache poisoning (Pharming)

### Q3: Cyber Threats (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Understanding various attacks.
-   **Text**:
    -   A (Brute Force) attack tries every password combination.
    -   (DDoS) floods a server with traffic to crash it.
    -   (Data Interception) involves stealing data during transmission.
    -   (Hacking) is gaining illegal access to a computer system.

### Q4: Social Engineering (Matching)
**Concept**: Types of social engineering.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Baiting -> Leaving an infected USB stick for someone to find
    -   Quid Pro Quo -> Offering a service in exchange for information
    -   Pretexting -> Creating a fake scenario to get data
    -   Phishing -> Sending fake emails to trick users

### Q5: Biometrics (True/False Grid)
**Concept**: Pros and cons of biometric security.
-   **Statements**:
    -   Fingerprints are unique to every individual. (True)
    -   Retina scans are quick and non-intrusive. (False)
    -   Biometrics can be lost or forgotten like passwords. (False)
    -   Voice recognition can be tricked by a recording. (True)

### Q6: Password Security (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: Identifying a strong password.
-   **Question**: Which of these is the strongest password?
-   **Options**:
    -   password123
    -   Steven1990
    -   Tr0ub4dor&3
    -   correcthorsebatterystaple (Actually strong but maybe stick to IGCSE definition of complexity) -> Let's use `P@55w0rd!` style for IGCSE context usually.
    -   **Revised Options**:
        -   password123 (Weak)
        -   MyNameIsJohn (Weak)
        -   Xy9#mP$2 (Strong)
        -   12345678 (Weak)
