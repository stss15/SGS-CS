## Question Design

### Q1: Sensors vs Actuators (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Distinguishing between input (sensors) and output (actuators) devices.
-   **Buckets**: Sensors (Input), Actuators (Output)
-   **Items**:
    -   Temperature Sensor (Sensors)
    -   Pressure Sensor (Sensors)
    -   Motor (Actuators)
    -   Pump (Actuators)
    -   Valve (Actuators)
    -   Light Sensor (Sensors)
    -   Heater (Actuators)
    -   Infrared Sensor (Sensors)

### Q2: The Automation Loop (Ordering)
**Concept**: The standard process of an automated system.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Sensors take readings from environment
    2.  Data converted from Analogue to Digital (ADC)
    3.  Microprocessor compares data to pre-set values
    4.  Signal sent to Actuators if action needed
    5.  Actuators perform the physical task

### Q3: Advantages vs Disadvantages (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Pros and cons of automation.
-   **Buckets**: Advantages, Disadvantages
-   **Items**:
    -   Faster response than humans (Advantages)
    -   Safer in dangerous environments (Advantages)
    -   Consistent results (Advantages)
    -   Expensive setup costs (Disadvantages)
    -   Susceptible to hacking (Disadvantages)
    -   High maintenance costs (Disadvantages)

### Q4: Application Scenarios (Matching)
**Concept**: Matching specific systems to their key features/benefits.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Nuclear Power Station -> Keeps humans away from radiation
    -   Adaptive Cruise Control -> Maintains safe distance from car in front
    -   Automated Irrigation -> Efficient use of water in large fields
    -   Weather Station -> Collects data from remote locations 24/7

### Q5: Sensor Selection (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Choosing the right sensor for the job.
-   **Text**:
    -   A (Thermometer) measures temperature.
    -   An (Anemometer) measures wind speed.
    -   A (Hygrometer) measures humidity.
    -   A (Barometer) measures air pressure.
    -   An (Accelerometer) detects motion/tilt in gaming.
