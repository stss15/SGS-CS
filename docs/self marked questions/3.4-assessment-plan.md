## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 3.4 using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: MAC vs IP (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Differences between Physical and Logical addresses.
-   **Buckets**: MAC Address, IP Address
-   **Items**:
    -   Physical Address (MAC)
    -   Set by Manufacturer (MAC)
    -   48-bit Hexadecimal (MAC)
    -   Logical Address (IP)
    -   Assigned by Network/ISP (IP)
    -   32-bit or 128-bit (IP)
    -   Can be Dynamic (IP)
    -   Stored on NIC (MAC)

### Q2: Hardware Definitions (Matching)
**Concept**: Roles of network components.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   NIC -> Hardware that allows a device to connect to a network
    -   Router -> Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN) and directs data
    -   DHCP Server -> Automatically assigns dynamic IP addresses to devices
    -   ISP -> Company that provides internet access and public IP addresses

### Q3: IP Versions (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: IPv4 vs IPv6.
-   **Text**:
    -   IPv4 addresses are (32) bits long and written in (denary).
    -   IPv6 addresses are (128) bits long and written in (hexadecimal).
    -   IPv6 was introduced because we ran out of (IPv4 addresses).
    -   IPv6 avoids IP (collisions) and has built-in security.

### Q4: MAC Address Format (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Structure of a MAC address.
-   **Text**:
    -   A MAC address is (48) bits long.
    -   It is usually written as 6 pairs of (hexadecimal) digits.
    -   The first half of the address identifies the (manufacturer).
    -   The second half is the device's unique (serial number).
    -   MAC addresses are hard-coded onto the (NIC).

### Q5: Static vs Dynamic IP (Matching)
**Concept**: Types of IP assignment.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Static IP -> Permanent address, useful for web servers
    -   Dynamic IP -> Temporary address assigned by DHCP, changes on reconnection
    -   Public IP -> Unique global address used on the internet
    -   Private IP -> Address used only within a local network (LAN)

### Q6: Router Operation (Ordering)
**Concept**: How a router handles data.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Data packet arrives at the router
    2.  Router inspects the destination IP address
    3.  Router checks its routing table for the best path
    4.  Packet is forwarded to the next network or switch
    5.  Packet is delivered to the destination device
