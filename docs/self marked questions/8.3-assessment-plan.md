## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 8.3 using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: File Operations (Matching)
**Concept**: Basic file commands.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   OPEN -> Prepares a file for use
    -   READ -> Retrieves data from a file
    -   WRITE -> Saves data to a file
    -   CLOSE -> Finishes using a file
    -   EOF -> End of File marker

### Q2: File Modes (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: Understanding READ vs WRITE modes.
-   **Question**: What happens if you open a file in WRITE mode that already exists?
-   **Options**:
    -   It is usually overwritten (Correct)
    -   Data is appended to the end
    -   It throws an error
    -   It opens in Read-Only mode

### Q3: Writing to File (Ordering)
**Concept**: Sequence for writing data.
-   **Order**:
    1.  `OPEN "MyFile.txt" FOR WRITE`
    2.  `OUTPUT "Enter text"`
    3.  `INPUT TextLine`
    4.  `WRITEFILE, TextLine`
    5.  `CLOSEFILE("MyFile.txt")`

### Q4: Reading from File (Ordering)
**Concept**: Sequence for reading data.
-   **Order**:
    1.  `OPEN "MyFile.txt" FOR READ`
    2.  `READFILE, TextLine`
    3.  `OUTPUT TextLine`
    4.  `CLOSEFILE("MyFile.txt")`

### Q5: Purpose of Files (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: Persistence.
-   **Question**: Why do we store data in files instead of just variables?
-   **Options**:
    -   To store data permanently after the program ends (Correct)
    -   To make the program run faster
    -   To use less RAM
    -   To encrypt the data automatically
