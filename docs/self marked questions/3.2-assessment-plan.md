# 3.2 Input & Output Devices Assessment Plan

## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 3.2 using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: Input vs Output (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Distinguishing between input and output devices.
-   **Buckets**: Input Device, Output Device
-   **Items**:
    -   Barcode Scanner (Input)
    -   Microphone (Input)
    -   Webcam (Input)
    -   Sensor (Input)
    -   Actuator (Output)
    -   Projector (Output)
    -   Laser Printer (Output)
    -   Speaker (Output)

### Q2: Touch Screen Technologies (Matching)
**Concept**: Characteristics of different touch screens.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Resistive -> Uses two layers that touch when pressed; works with gloves
    -   Capacitive -> Uses the body's electrical current; supports multi-touch
    -   Infrared -> Uses a grid of light beams; expensive but durable

### Q3: Printers (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Differences between printer types.
-   **Text**:
    -   (Inkjet) printers use liquid ink and are good for high-quality photos.
    -   (Laser) printers use powdered toner and are best for high-volume text.
    -   (3D) printers use additive manufacturing to build objects layer by layer.
    -   Laser printers use (static electricity) to stick toner to the drum.

### Q4: QR Codes vs Barcodes (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Comparison of barcode technologies.
-   **Text**:
    -   QR codes are (2D) while standard barcodes are (1D).
    -   QR codes can hold (more) data than barcodes.
    -   QR codes can be read by (smartphones) using a camera.
    -   Barcodes require a (laser) scanner to read.
    -   QR codes have built-in (error correction).

### Q5: Digital Camera Process (Ordering)
**Concept**: How a digital image is captured.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Light passes through the lens
    2.  Light hits the sensor (CCD)
    3.  Sensor converts light into analogue electric currents
    4.  ADC converts analogue signals to digital data
    5.  Image is stored as a file (e.g., JPEG)

### Q6: Screen Technologies (Matching)
**Concept**: LCD vs LED vs OLED.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   LCD -> Uses liquid crystals and requires separate backlighting
    -   LED Screen -> LCD screen backlit by LEDs; thinner and brighter
    -   OLED -> Organic material emits its own light; no backlight needed
    -   DLP Projector -> Uses millions of tiny mirrors to project an image

-   **Template**: `public/igcse/topic3/3.1_assessment.html` (Reuse the file I just created as it has the updated structure)
