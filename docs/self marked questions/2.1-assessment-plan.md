## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 2.1 using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: Packet Structure (Drag & Drop)
**Concept**: Components of a data packet.
-   **Buckets**: Header, Payload, Trailer
-   **Items**:
    -   Sender IP Address (Header)
    -   Receiver IP Address (Header)
    -   Sequence Number (Header)
    -   Actual Data (~64 KiB) (Payload)
    -   End of Packet Marker (Trailer)
    -   Error Check / CRC (Trailer)

### Q2: Transmission Modes (Matching)
**Concept**: Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex definitions.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Simplex -> One direction only (e.g. Computer to Printer)
    -   Half-Duplex -> Both directions but not at same time (e.g. Walkie-Talkie)
    -   Full-Duplex -> Both directions simultaneously (e.g. Broadband)
    -   Serial -> One bit at a time over single wire
    -   Parallel -> Multiple bits at a time over multiple wires

### Q3: Serial vs Parallel (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Pros and cons of serial vs parallel.
-   **Buckets**: Serial Transmission, Parallel Transmission
-   **Items**:
    -   Slower transmission rate (Serial)
    -   Good for long distances (Serial)
    -   No data skewing (Serial)
    -   Faster transmission rate (Parallel)
    -   Good for short distances / internal CPU (Parallel)
    -   Prone to data skewing / interference (Parallel)

### Q4: USB Features (True/False Drag)
**Concept**: Universal Serial Bus characteristics.
-   **True**:
    -   USB uses serial data transmission.
    -   Devices are automatically detected (Plug & Play).
    -   Cable supplies power (+5V).
    -   Connectors fit only one way (preventing errors).
-   **False**:
    -   USB uses parallel data transmission.
    -   USB cables can be unlimited length (Max ~5m).
    -   USB only supports simplex transmission.

### Q5: Packet Switching (Ordering)
**Concept**: How packet switching works.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Data is broken into packets
    2.  Packets travel independently via routers
    3.  Routers decide the path for each packet
    4.  Packets arrive (possibly out of order)
    5.  Packets are reassembled using sequence numbers

### Q6: Data Skewing (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Why parallel fails over distance.
-   **Text**:
    -   In (parallel) transmission, multiple wires are used.
    -   Over long distances, bits may arrive at different times due to wire properties.
    -   This causes the data to become (skewed) or unsynchronised.
    -   Therefore, (serial) transmission is preferred for long distances.
