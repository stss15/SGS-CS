# 1.1 Number Systems Assessment Plan

## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 1.1 Number Systems using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: Terminology Match (Matching Pairs)
**Concept**: Basic units (bit, nibble, byte) and definitions.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Bit -> Single 0 or 1
    -   Nibble -> 4 bits
    -   Byte -> 8 bits
    -   Binary -> Base 2 number system
    -   Hexadecimal -> Base 16 number system
    -   Denary -> Base 10 number system

### Q2: Binary & Hex Concepts (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Why computers use binary, Hex usage.
-   **Text**:
    -   Computers use binary because transistors act as switches that are either (ON/OFF).
    -   Hexadecimal is used because it is (shorter/easier) for humans to read than binary.
    -   One hexadecimal digit represents exactly (4) bits.
    -   The hexadecimal digit for 10 is (A).
    -   The hexadecimal digit for 15 is (F).

### Q3: Binary Conversions & Addition (Categorisation/Drag & Drop)
**Concept**: Identifying correct conversions or properties.
-   **Buckets**: Valid Binary, Invalid Binary (or maybe "8-bit Overflow" vs "Valid Sum")
-   **Alternative**: Drag numbers to their binary equivalent?
-   **Better**: **Categorise Statements** into "True" and "False" regarding binary/hex properties.
    -   True: "Left shift multiplies by 2", "Right shift divides by 2", "Overflow occurs when result is too big for bit-width".
    -   False: "Left shift divides by 2", "Hexadecimal is understood by computers directly", "Two's complement is for unsigned numbers".

### Q4: Logical Shifts (Dropdown)
**Concept**: Effect of shifts.
-   **Scenario**:
    -   Shifting 00110101 (53) Left by 1 results in (106).
    -   This operation (multiplies) the number by 2.
    -   Shifting 10110000 (176) Right by 2 results in (44).
    -   Bits shifted out are (lost).

### Q5: Two's Complement (Ordering)
**Concept**: Steps to convert negative number.
-   **Steps**:
    1.  Write the positive number in binary
    2.  Invert all the bits (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)
    3.  Add 1 to the result

### Q6: Hexadecimal Conversions (Matching)
**Concept**: Match Denary/Binary to Hex.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   10 (Denary) -> A (Hex)
    -   15 (Denary) -> F (Hex)
    -   1111 (Binary) -> F (Hex)
    -   1010 (Binary) -> A (Hex)
    -   255 (Denary) -> FF (Hex)

## Implementation Details
-   **File**: `public/igcse/topic1/1.1_assessment.html`
-   **Template**: `docs/agent/templates/igcse-assessment-template.md`
-   **Assets**: None required (text-based).

## Verification
-   Check all questions against 1.1.txt content.
-   Verify correct answers in JS.
-   Test PDF generation.
