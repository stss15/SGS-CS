## Question Design

### Q1: RAM vs ROM (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Differences between Primary Memory types.
-   **Buckets**: RAM, ROM
-   **Items**:
    -   Volatile (RAM)
    -   Read and Write (RAM)
    -   Stores currently running programs (RAM)
    -   Non-volatile (ROM)
    -   Read Only (ROM)
    -   Stores BIOS/Bootstrap (ROM)
    -   Permanent (ROM)
    -   Temporary (RAM)

### Q2: Storage Technologies (Matching)
**Concept**: Categorising storage by technology.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Magnetic -> Uses spinning platters and read/write heads (e.g., HDD)
    -   Optical -> Uses lasers to read pits and lands (e.g., DVD)
    -   Solid State -> Uses flash memory with no moving parts (e.g., SSD)

### Q3: Optical Media (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Comparing CD, DVD, and Blu-ray.
-   **Text**:
    -   (CDs) have the smallest capacity (~700MB) and use a red laser.
    -   (DVDs) hold ~4.7GB and also use a red laser.
    -   (Blu-ray) discs hold 25GB+ and use a blue-violet laser.
    -   A (Blue) laser has a shorter wavelength than a (Red) laser, allowing smaller pits.

### Q4: Virtual Memory (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: How virtual memory works.
-   **Text**:
    -   Virtual memory uses part of the (HDD/SSD) to act as extended RAM.
    -   Data is swapped between RAM and disk in blocks called (pages).
    -   (Thrashing) occurs when the disk is overworked moving data in and out.
    -   Virtual memory prevents system (crashes) when physical RAM is full.

### Q5: Cloud Storage (Matching)
**Concept**: Types of cloud environments.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Public Cloud -> Storage hosted by a third party, accessible via internet
    -   Private Cloud -> Dedicated storage servers behind a company firewall
    -   Hybrid Cloud -> A mix of sensitive private storage and general public storage

### Q6: Data Access Speed (Ordering)
**Concept**: Hierarchy of memory speeds.
-   **Order (Fastest to Slowest)**:
    1.  CPU Cache (SRAM)
    2.  RAM (DRAM)
    3.  Solid State Drive (SSD)
    4.  Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
    5.  Optical Disc (CD/DVD)
