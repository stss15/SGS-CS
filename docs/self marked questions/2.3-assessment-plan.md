## Question Design

### Q1: Encryption Terminology (Matching)
**Concept**: Definitions of key terms.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Plaintext -> The original message before encryption
    -   Ciphertext -> The scrambled message after encryption
    -   Encryption Algorithm -> The formula used to scramble the data
    -   Key -> A secret value used to encrypt/decrypt
    -   Symmetric Encryption -> Uses the same key for encryption and decryption
    -   Asymmetric Encryption -> Uses a public key and a private key

### Q2: Symmetric vs Asymmetric (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Distinguishing between the two methods.
-   **Buckets**: Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption
-   **Items**:
    -   Uses a single key (Symmetric)
    -   Faster to process (Symmetric)
    -   Key distribution is a security risk (Symmetric)
    -   Uses a public and private key pair (Asymmetric)
    -   Public key can be shared with anyone (Asymmetric)
    -   More secure for key exchange (Asymmetric)

### Q3: Asymmetric Process (Ordering)
**Concept**: How a message is sent securely using asymmetric encryption.
-   **Scenario**: Tom wants to send a secret message to Jane.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Jane generates a public/private key pair
    2.  Jane sends her public key to Tom
    3.  Tom encrypts the message using Jane's public key
    4.  Tom sends the ciphertext to Jane
    5.  Jane decrypts the message using her private key

### Q4: Encryption Purpose (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Why we use encryption.
-   **Text**:
    -   Encryption is used to protect data from (eavesdroppers/hackers).
    -   It turns (plaintext) into (ciphertext).
    -   It does not prevent interception, but makes the data (unreadable/meaningless).
    -   This is essential for sending sensitive info like (credit card details) over the internet.
    -   https websites use (encryption/SSL) to secure data.

### Q5: Caesar Cipher Logic (Dropdown)
**Concept**: Simple symmetric encryption example (shift cipher).
-   **Scenario**: A shift of +3 is used (A -> D).
    -   The plaintext "CAT" becomes (FDW).
    -   The ciphertext "DPH" decrypts to (AME).
    -   If the key is lost, the data cannot be (decrypted/read).
    -   This is a type of (symmetric) encryption.

### Q6: Public/Private Key Roles (True/False Drag)
**Concept**: Specific roles of keys.
-   **True**:
    -   A public key can be given to anyone.
    -   A private key must be kept secret.
    -   Data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the matching private key.
-   **False**:
    -   A public key can decrypt messages created with the public key.
    -   Private keys are shared with the sender.
    -   Symmetric encryption uses two different keys.
