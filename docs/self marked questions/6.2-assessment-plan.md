## Question Design

### Q1: Characteristics of a Robot (True/False Grid)
**Concept**: The three defining traits of a robot.
-   **Statements**:
    -   Ability to sense surroundings (True)
    -   Ability to move (True)
    -   Programmable (True)
    -   Must look like a human (False)
    -   Must have Artificial Intelligence (False)

### Q2: Independent vs Dependent (Drag & Drop)
**Concept**: Classifying robots based on human intervention.
-   **Buckets**: Independent (Autonomous), Dependent (Human Interface)
-   **Items**:
    -   Driverless Car (Independent)
    -   Mars Rover (Independent)
    -   Surgical Robot (Dependent)
    -   Factory Arm with Operator (Dependent)
    -   Autonomous Vacuum (Independent)

### Q3: Robot Components (Matching)
**Concept**: Functions of key robot parts.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Sensor -> Input device to sense environment
    -   Microprocessor -> The 'brain' that processes data
    -   Actuator -> Creates movement (motors, pistons)
    -   End-effector -> Tool attached to arm (gripper, spray gun)

### Q4: Industry Applications (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: How robots are used in manufacturing.
-   **Text**:
    -   Robots are good at (repetitive) tasks.
    -   They can work (24/7) without breaks.
    -   They can work in (hazardous) environments.
    -   However, they are (expensive) to set up.

### Q5: Advantages vs Disadvantages (Categorisation)
**Concept**: General pros and cons of robotics.
-   **Buckets**: Advantages, Disadvantages
-   **Items**:
    -   Higher productivity (Advantages)
    -   Consistent quality (Advantages)
    -   Can work in dangerous places (Advantages)
    -   Loss of jobs/unemployment (Disadvantages)
    -   Deskilling of workforce (Disadvantages)
    -   High initial cost (Disadvantages)

### Q6: Terminology (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: Specific terms.
-   **Question**: What is a 'Drone'?
-   **Options**:
    -   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Correct)
    -   A robot that cleans floors
    -   A type of sensor
    -   A robot controller
