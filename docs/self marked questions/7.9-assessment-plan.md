## Question Design

### Q1: Algorithm Stages (Ordering)
**Concept**: The process of creating an algorithm.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Clearly specify the problem and tasks
    2.  Break the problem down into sub-problems
    3.  Decide on data storage and processing
    4.  Design the structure (Structure Diagram)
    5.  Construct the algorithm (Flowchart/Pseudocode)
    6.  Test with Normal, Abnormal, and Boundary data

### Q2: Loop Selection (Matching)
**Concept**: Choosing the right loop for the task.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   FOR Loop -> Fixed number of iterations known beforehand
    -   REPEAT...UNTIL -> Runs at least once, checks condition at end
    -   WHILE...DO -> Checks condition at start, may not run at all
    -   Infinite Loop -> Condition is never met (Error)

### Q3: Algorithm Efficiency (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: Improving a linear search.
-   **Scenario**: Searching for a number in a sorted list of 1000 items.
-   **Question**: Which change would make the search most efficient?
-   **Options**:
    -   Stop the search as soon as the number is found (Correct)
    -   Search backwards from the end
    -   Search every item twice to be sure
    -   Use a random search

### Q4: Amending Logic (Drag & Drop)
**Concept**: Fixing a logic error in a total calculation.
-   **Snippet**:
    ```
    Total <- 0
    Count <- 1
    REPEAT
       INPUT Num
       Total <- Total * Num  <-- Error here (should be +)
       Count <- Count + 1
    UNTIL Count > 10
    ```
-   **Buckets**: Correct Line, Incorrect Line
-   **Items**:
    -   Total <- Total + Num (Correct)
    -   Total <- Total * Num (Incorrect)
    -   Total <- 0 (Correct)
    -   Count <- 0 (Incorrect - usually 1 or 0 depending on logic, but here 1 is fine for >10 check if we want 10 items. Let's stick to the obvious error)
    -   **Revised Items**:
        -   Total <- Total + Num (Correct Fix)
        -   Total <- Total * Num (Original Error)
        -   Total <- Num (Incorrect - overwrites)
        -   Total <- Total - Num (Incorrect)

### Q5: Writing Pseudocode (Ordering)
**Concept**: Constructing a simple average calculator.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Total <- 0
    2.  FOR Count <- 1 TO 10
    3.  INPUT Number
    4.  Total <- Total + Number
    5.  NEXT Count
    6.  Average <- Total / 10
    7.  OUTPUT Average
