# 1.2 Text, Sound and Images Assessment Plan

## Goal
Create a self-marking assessment for Topic 1.2 using the standard template.

## Question Design

### Q1: Character Sets (Matching)
**Concept**: ASCII vs Unicode definitions.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   ASCII -> 7-bit character set (128 codes)
    -   Extended ASCII -> 8-bit character set (256 codes)
    -   Unicode -> Universal character set (emojis, global languages)
    -   UTF-8 -> Variable length encoding (1-4 bytes)
    -   Code Point -> Numeric value assigned to a character

### Q2: Sound Sampling (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: How sound is digitised.
-   **Text**:
    -   The number of samples taken per second is called the (sample rate).
    -   It is measured in (Hz).
    -   The number of bits used to store each sample is the (sample resolution).
    -   To capture a frequency cleanly, the sample rate must be at least (2x) the highest frequency (Nyquist).
    -   Increasing the sample rate results in a (larger) file size.

### Q3: Image Properties (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Bitmap vs Vector, Effects of changing properties.
-   **Buckets**: Bitmap Images, Vector Images
-   **Items**:
    -   Made of pixels (Bitmap)
    -   Made of mathematical formulas (Vector)
    -   Scales without losing quality (Vector)
    -   Better for photographs (Bitmap)
    -   Better for logos and icons (Vector)
    -   File size = width x height x colour depth (Bitmap)

### Q4: File Size Calculations (Dropdown)
**Concept**: Calculating size for sound and images.
-   **Scenario**:
    -   Image: 100 x 100 pixels with 8-bit colour depth.
    -   Total bits = 100 x 100 x (8) = 80,000 bits.
    -   Sound: 10 seconds, 100 Hz sample rate, 8-bit resolution, 1 channel.
    -   Total bits = 10 x 100 x (8) x 1 = 8,000 bits.
    -   If colour depth increases, file size (increases).

### Q5: Unicode vs ASCII (True/False Drag)
**Concept**: Misconceptions.
-   **True**:
    -   Unicode can represent emojis.
    -   ASCII is limited to English letters and symbols.
    -   UTF-8 is an encoding for Unicode.
-   **False**:
    -   ASCII can store Chinese characters.
    -   Unicode always uses 1 byte per character.
    -   Extended ASCII is the same as Unicode.

### Q6: Sound Quality (Ordering)
**Concept**: Factors affecting quality/size.
-   **Order**: (Not really an ordering task, maybe "Process of digitising sound"?)
    1.  Microphone captures analogue wave
    2.  ADC samples the wave at regular intervals
    3.  Each sample is quantized to a binary value
    4.  Binary data is stored in file
