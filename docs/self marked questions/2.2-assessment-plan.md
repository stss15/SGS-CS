## Question Design

### Q1: Error Detection Methods (Matching)
**Concept**: Definitions of Parity, Checksum, Echo Check, ARQ.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Parity Check -> Uses a bit to ensure even/odd number of 1s
    -   Checksum -> Calculates a value from data block to compare at receiver
    -   Echo Check -> Sends data back to sender for comparison
    -   ARQ -> Uses acknowledgements and timeouts
    -   Check Digit -> Final digit calculated from other digits (e.g. ISBN)

### Q2: Parity Logic (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: How parity works.
-   **Text**:
    -   In (even) parity, the number of 1-bits must be an even number.
    -   If the byte is 1011001, it has (4) ones.
    -   The parity bit should be (0) to keep it even.
    -   If the byte is 1011000, it has (3) ones.
    -   The parity bit should be (1) to make it even.

### Q3: ARQ Process (Ordering)
**Concept**: Automatic Repeat Request steps.
-   **Order**:
    1.  Sender transmits data block
    2.  Receiver checks for errors (e.g. using CRC)
    3.  If error found, Receiver sends Negative Acknowledgement
    4.  Sender re-transmits data
    5.  If no error, Receiver sends Positive Acknowledgement
    6.  If timeout occurs, Sender automatically re-transmits

### Q4: Check Digit Uses (True/False Drag)
**Concept**: Purpose and types of errors detected.
-   **True**:
    -   Used for barcodes and ISBNs.
    -   Detects incorrect digits entered.
    -   Detects transposition errors (swapped numbers).
    -   Calculated from all other digits in the code.
-   **False**:
    -   Corrects the error automatically.
    -   Used to encrypt data.
    -   Prevents data from being intercepted.

### Q5: Parity Block (Dropdown)
**Concept**: Identifying the error position.
-   **Scenario**: A parity block is shown.
    -   Row 3 has incorrect parity.
    -   Column 2 has incorrect parity.
    -   The error is at the intersection of (Row 3) and (Column 2).
    -   This bit should be flipped to correct the error.
    -   This method allows for (error correction) as well as detection.

### Q6: Error Causes (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Why errors occur.
-   **Buckets**: Causes of Error, Error Prevention
-   **Items**:
    -   Electrical interference (Cause)
    -   Packet switching problems (Cause)
    -   Data skewing (Cause)
    -   Shielding cables (Prevention)
    -   Parity checking (Prevention/Detection)
    -   ARQ (Prevention/Detection)
