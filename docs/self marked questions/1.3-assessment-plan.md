## Question Design

### Q1: Binary Prefixes (Matching)
**Concept**: Units of measurement (KiB, MiB, GiB).
-   **Pairs**:
    -   1 KiB -> 1,024 bytes (2^10)
    -   1 MiB -> 1,048,576 bytes (2^20)
    -   1 GiB -> 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30)
    -   1 KB -> 1,000 bytes (Decimal)
    -   Bit -> Single 0 or 1
    -   Byte -> 8 bits

### Q2: Compression Types (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Lossy vs Lossless.
-   **Buckets**: Lossy Compression, Lossless Compression
-   **Items**:
    -   Removes data permanently (Lossy)
    -   Original file can be perfectly reconstructed (Lossless)
    -   Used for ZIP files and text (Lossless)
    -   Used for MP3 and JPEG (Lossy)
    -   Higher compression ratio usually (Lossy)
    -   No quality loss (Lossless)

### Q3: Image Size Calculation (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Calculating bitmap size.
-   **Scenario**:
    -   Image: 100 x 50 pixels with 4-bit colour depth.
    -   Total pixels = 100 x 50 = (5,000).
    -   Total bits = 5,000 x (4) = 20,000 bits.
    -   Total bytes = 20,000 / (8) = 2,500 bytes.
    -   If colour depth changes to 8-bit, the file size will (double).

### Q4: Sound Size Calculation (Dropdown)
**Concept**: Calculating sound file size.
-   **Scenario**:
    -   Sound: 10 seconds, 1000 Hz, 8-bit resolution, Mono (1 channel).
    -   Formula: Sample Rate x Resolution x Duration x Channels.
    -   Calculation: 1000 x 8 x 10 x 1 = (80,000) bits.
    -   In bytes: 80,000 / 8 = (10,000) bytes.
    -   If it was Stereo (2 channels), the size would be (20,000) bytes.

### Q5: Compression Concepts (True/False Drag)
**Concept**: Misconceptions.
-   **True**:
    -   Compression reduces file size for storage and transmission.
    -   RLE is a form of lossless compression.
    -   Lossy compression is not suitable for text files.
-   **False**:
    -   Lossless compression reduces quality.
    -   KB and KiB are exactly the same size.
    -   Compression changes the RAM required to edit the file.

### Q6: RLE Logic (Ordering)
**Concept**: How RLE works (simplified).
-   **Order**:
    1.  Scan data for runs of repeated values
    2.  Count the number of repetitions
    3.  Store the value and the count
    4.  Repeat for the next run
