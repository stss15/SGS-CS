## Question Design

### Q1: AI Categories (Matching)
**Concept**: Defining the three levels of AI.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Narrow AI -> Superior to humans in one specific task
    -   General AI -> Similar performance to humans in a specific task
    -   Strong AI -> Superior to humans in many tasks

### Q2: Expert System Components (Matching)
**Concept**: The parts of an expert system.
-   **Pairs**:
    -   Knowledge Base -> Repository of facts and objects
    -   Rules Base -> Set of inference rules (IF-THEN)
    -   Inference Engine -> Search engine that applies rules to facts
    -   User Interface -> Allows interaction with the system

### Q3: AI vs Machine Learning (Categorisation)
**Concept**: Distinguishing between the broader field and the subset.
-   **Buckets**: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML)
-   **Items**:
    -   Simulates human intelligence (AI)
    -   Branch of Computer Science (AI)
    -   Uses training data to learn (ML)
    -   Makes predictions on unseen data (ML)
    -   Improves performance over time (ML)

### Q4: Expert System Process (Ordering)
**Concept**: How an expert system reaches a conclusion.
-   **Order**:
    1.  User enters data via User Interface
    2.  Inference Engine interrogates Knowledge Base
    3.  Inference Rules applied to facts
    4.  System generates a conclusion/diagnosis
    5.  Explanation System gives reasoning

### Q5: Applications (Dropdown Gap Fill)
**Concept**: Real-world uses.
-   **Text**:
    -   (Expert Systems) are used for medical diagnosis.
    -   (Machine Learning) is used for spam detection.
    -   (Chatbots) simulate conversation with humans.
    -   (Deep Learning) uses artificial neural networks.

### Q6: Key Terms (Multiple Choice)
**Concept**: The Turing Test.
-   **Question**: What is the Turing Test?
-   **Options**:
    -   A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to a human (Correct)
    -   A test for computer speed
    -   A test for robot movement
    -   A test for network security
