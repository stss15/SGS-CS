# Wide area network:
a system that connects

computers and other
devices across a large
geographic area, usually
connecting multiple
LANs together.
# Personal area
network: a network
for personal devices
within the range of
an individual person,
usually connected
with Bluetooth.

A wide area network provides for the interconnection of multiple local area networks over a
wider geographical distance. This connection distance may be across town, berween different
cities or even different continents. For example, this could be for sharing resources across
ditferent oftice branches of a company.
Classically, a WAN does not use the internet for this interconnection; instead it would have
its own dedicated networking infrastructure for long-distance connections, such as fibre-optic
cabling or point-to-point microwave Lransmission.
In practice, most modern WANSs use the existing infrastructure of high-speed internet and
establish a virtualized WAN through the use of virtual private networking rechnology,
discussed below.

B Personal area networks (PAN)
A personal area network refers to the devices that are

interconnected, centred around an individual person. A PAN
covers a very small range, and is typically limited to about
10 metres.
While USB cable-connected devices could be said to be part

Companies use the secure tunnel of a VPN to provide employees with remote access to their

corporate networks as if they were physically present at their corporate headquarters.
VPNs help reduce the need for expensive dedicated networking infrastructure over long

A2.1.2 The purpose, benefits and limitations

of modern digital infrastructures
B Internet
To suggest the internet is a core component of modern digital infrastructure 1s a bit like saying
water is wet. The internet is the global network. It connects millions of private, public, academic,
business and government networks to one massive global network. It provides easy access to a
vast amount of information and services, as well as tacilitating near-instant communications.
Commerce, businesses and global marketplaces are now extremely dependent upon it.
That said, the internet is far from perfect. In the 1970s and 80s, as key components of what would
become the internet were being developed, there was no master plan, and the sheer scale of the
result would have been impossible to imagine or foresee. This means there are vulnerabilities
baked into the core technologies on which the internet depends. It is susceptible to hacking,
denial of service, phishing and many other threats that we will look at later in this chapter.

B Cloud computing
‘]\"“

The cloud is a mysterious-sounding name for a critical part of modern infrastructure devised

“I'

by a marketing major somewhere. In essence, it is computing services being made available
for rent by large technology companies so that you don’t need to purchase your own physical
computer systems for servers and other infrastructure. Businesses and individuals can use the
internet to access the software and hardware provided by these technology companies in their
giant data centres.
There are some benefits to this approach. It means resource utilization can be easily scaled up

or down without large financial investment. It also reduces the IT maintenance costs for small
companies, as it is all part of the rented service.
Due to communication with cloud-rented systems occurring over the internet, thar clearly
means reliable, stable, high-speed internet connectivity is a must. Concerns about the security
and privacy of data held on these third-party systems can also be a legitimate concern, as these
systems are beyond your control.

Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are three big cloud providers, at the

Role of experts in consumption or acquisition of knowledge
Computer networks, such as the internet, rely upon the expertise of network engineers to keep the

@ Linking question
: How do cloud computing and distributed systems utilize networking to deliver services?

H Distributed systems
A distributed system connects multiple computers, or
nerworks of computers, together to achieve common goals.

They are more fault tolerant than other systems as, if one
node fails, there are other paths of connectivity through
which the rest of the network can continue to function.
This resilience comes at the cost of complexity, meaning
they are more difficult to design, manage and maintain. In

particular, ensuring data consistency across the various
nodes can be a challenge.
Peer-to-peer networking tools, such as BitTorrent, are

examples of distributed systems, as are Blockchains.
M With each dot representing a node on the network, a

distributed system has many different paths to traverse between

A2.1 Network fundamentals

Distributed systems used by some large corporate networks
include Content Delivery Networks to help distribute
content to users worldwide.

l Edge computing
Edge computing brings the computational and data storage capacity closer to the physical
location where it is needed, to reduce latency and save bandwidth.
Large content delivery companies, such as Netflix, Spotify and the like, may use the edge
computing model to deploy clusters of servers in key cities so as to reduce the amount of
traffic that must travel back and forth to their main hubs. These servers can cache the most
commonly sought-after files for each region, significantly speeding up the service for those
customers, while preserving bandwidth for obtaining occasionally requested files that are not
in the local cache.
This increase in endpoints to the network presents an increase in attack vectors for an
adversary, so it comes with increased security and maintenance complexities.

B Mobile networks
Mobile telecommunications networks are now globally ubiquitous. There are many parts of the

world where mobile connectivity is the only connectivity available, as mobile networks can be
deployed without the cost of digging up the ground for cabling installations.
The mobility that these networks facilitate allows convenient access to information and
communication while on the go, and supports vast regions. That said, the necessity to place
towers everywhere and the complexities of geography do mean that mobile-phone networks
do have dead zones, which are areas without network coverage. Signal strength can vary, which
affects quality of service and bandwidth throughput.

At the time of writing, many countries are in the process of deploying fifth generation mobile
networks (5G), which will increase speeds to up to 10 Gbps for peak data, with an average of
100 Mbps.

M Devices in a typical home or small office network

Many home or small office networks might have only a single physical device that connects
all their devices to their internet service provider. This single device might be colloquially
referred to as the router or modem. The reality is that there are several logical devices at work,
even if they are all co-located in a single physical unit. We will examine the roles of these

different devices now.

(;Top tip!
Understand the purpose!
There are a lot of different devices that serve different roles within a computer network. It can be
easy to get them confused because most home networks have one physical device that plays many
of these roles. Focus on understanding each device type’s purpose and functionality. Ask yourself
why this device type is needed, and what problems it solves.

B Gateway
* Gateway: a device

A gateway is, as the name implies, the gate or connection between two networks. These

that connects different

networks may be communicating with two different protocols, and the gateway performs the

networks together and
manages the traffic flow
between them; often

used to connect a local

network to the internet.

For instance, in a typical home environment where the gateway connects to the internet
service provider via a fibre-optic cable, it may be translating between EPON (Ethernet passive

optical network) and regular Ethernet.
Because it converts from one network to another, it primarily operates at the application layer
of the TCP/TP model (see Section A2.1.5).

A2.1 Network fundamentals

M Hardware firewall
# Firewall: a security
system (hardware or
software) that monitors

and controls incoming
and outgoing network
traffic based on a set of
security rules.
# Router: a device that
forwards data packets
between computer
networks, routing the
traffic along the most
efficient path.
4 Network switch:
a device that connects
multiple other devices
within a single segment
of a computer network,

only forwarding data to
the specific device it is
intended for.

The hardware firewall monitors and allows or denies incoming and outgoing network traftic
based on a predetermined set of security rules. The purpose is to be a safeguarding barrier

between the locally trusted network and the untrusted network of the internet.
Firewall rules are typically a list of IP addresses and / or TCP/UDP ports to allow or deny
traffic, based on the origin address or port and destination address or port.
The device functions at the transport and internet layers of the TCPF/IP model (see
Section A2.1.5).

Hl Modem
A modem is a modulator—demodulator. It is used to convert between digital and analogue
signals. A digital signal is modulated to encode digital data into an analogue form, transmitted
across the analogue medium, such as phone lines, and then demodulated at the other end to
extract the digital data.
The device functions at the physical, network interface layer of the TCP/IP model (see

Section A2.1.5).

B Network interface card
The network interface card is the hardware component on an individual device, such as a
laptop or mobile phone, that allows it to connect to the network. It may be a card that requires
connecting a physical cable, such as Ethernet twisted pair or fibre optic, or it could have an
antenna attached for connecting to a wireless nerwork.
The device functions at the physical, network interface layer of the TCP/IP model (see

Section A2.1.5).

Bl Router
The router directs the path packets of data take between networks. It inspects the network
address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination and uses that
to send the packet on the optimal route.
The router typically operates at the network interface layer of the TCP/IP model, as it uses
TCP/IP addresses to make its routing decisions (see Section A2.1.5).

Thinking skills: A network router on a rocket flight has been accidentally reset, so
that it is blocking legitimate traffic between the rocket and mission control. The task
to fix it falls to you. Search Coding Quest and select “Broken firewall”, or go to https://
codingquest.io/problem/29, to complete this activity.

B Switch
A network switch connects devices within a single segment of a network. The switch
effectively creates a network; it is the central spoke in a star-based network. A switch receives
incoming packets of data and sends them on to their destination within the local area network
using MAC addresses.
The switch operates at the network interface layer of the TCF/IP model (see Section A2.1.5).

A2 Networks

B Wireless access point
Wireless access points connect wireless devices together to form a network, in the same
way that a switch does for a physical network. They can also act as range extenders for

wireless signals.
A wireless access point operates at the network interface layer of the TCP/IP model (see
Section A2.1.5).

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operate on the

transport layer of the TCP/IP model. That is, they are packets that are contained within the data
portion of an IP packet. Where IP is responsible for getting a packet from one computer system to
another, the TCP or UDP is responsible for getting data from one application to another.
4 Protocol: a set of
rules and standards
that define how data is

These protocols facilitate multiple applications sharing a common network connection at

transmitted and received

inbound traffic to for processing. This is where port numbers come in. Think of these as phone

across a network for a
given application.

extensions, or apartment numbers within a building address. To assist matters even further,

once. For instance, if a server is running both an email-server application and a web-server
application, the host operating system needs a means of determining which application to send

the industry has standardized default port numbers for commonly used applications. The
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) uses port 587 and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

uses port 80, whereas Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) uses 443 and the Secure
Shell (SSI) uses port 22.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. This means it establishes and maintains an active
connection with the remote server until the application programs on both ends have finished
exchanging messages. TCP ensures that data is delivered in order, without errors, and that
data is acknowledged upon receipt. If there is an error in the receipt of a packet (either it
doesn't arrive or is corrupted in some way), it is re-sent. The sequence number is used to
ensure packets are reassembled into their correct order by the receiving application, and the
checksum is used to ensure it is not corrupted during transmission.
UDP is a connectionless protocol. Data is transmitted, but there is no guarantee of reliability
or order of delivery. UDP is used for applications such as streaming video, where maintaining
speed and staying up to date with the broadcast is more important than the occasional missed
frame or subset of pixels.
Sometimes a light-hearted approach can help communicate the difference between two items.
Here is an anecdote that does the rounds of the internet comparing TCP and UDP:

A TCP joke:
Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?
Yes, I'd like to hear a TCP joke.
OK, I'll tell you a TCP joke.
OK, I'll hear a TCP joke.
Are you ready to hear a TCP joke?
Yes, | am ready to hear a TCP joke.
OK, I'm about to send the TCP joke. It will last 10 seconds, it has two characters, it does
not have a setting, it ends with a punchline.
OK, I'm ready to hear the TCP joke that will last 10 seconds, has two characters, does
not have a setting and will end with a punchline.
I'm sorry, your connection has timed out ... Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?

A UDP joke:

| know a UDP joke, but you might not get it.

You can programmatically experiment with communicating directly over TCPF/IP connections

with code similar to the following code.

B Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is the foundation of the world wide web. It is the protocol used for the transmission of
hypermedia documents, such as HTML, as well as associated text files (Javascript, CSS) or
binary files (images and so on).

HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that each command is executed independently of
any previous commands, with no recollection or knowledge of them. The client (such as a web
browser) sends requests to the web server, which then responds with the requested resource or
an error code.
HTTP communication occurs as unicode text strings, so it is human-readable.
An example of an HTTP request from a browser might resemble the following text. The client
is sending a GET request for a particular file called index. html from the server hosting
www .example . com.
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host:

www. example -com

The associated reply from the web server follows. The server begins by indicating it is replying
using the HTTP v1.1 protocol and a status code of 200, which means OK. If there is an error
then a different status code would be received. For instance, if the requested file was not found
then a status of 404 would be sent.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type:

text/html

Content-Length:
<!DOCTYPE

1456

html>

<html>

<heads>
<title>Example Website</titlex>
</head>
<body>
<hl>Welcome to the Example Website!</hl>
<p>This is the content of the index.html web page.</p>
</body>
</html=

This is a simple example; in practice, there is also commonly authentication information,

cookies and other data sent as part of the request or response.

A2 Networks

You can programmatically experiment with sending your own HTTP requests and receiving
the responses with Python by using the requests library. For instance, a simple program
may look like this:

The requests library is very powerful and even lets you download or upload text files and

binary files.
1f youd like to create your own web server that receives and processes HTTP requests, take a look

at Python’s Flask library. A simple web-server application may resemble the following code:
b

Python
from flask import Flask,

render template,

request,

redirect,

send file

app = Flask(_ name )
app.config["SECRET
KEY"] = "code used to secure cookies from tampering"
# Return templates/index.html
@app.route ("/")

def index page():
return render template ("index.html")

# Return a binary file
@app .route (" /promotional
video")

def promoticnal wvideo():
return send file("promotional video.mp4")
# Use the URL path to supply a parameter
@app.route
(" /user/<userid=")
def users (userid) :

return "User page for "+userid
# Get values from an HTML form

@app.route
(" /page2",

methods=["GET", "POST"])

def page2():
# HTML with <input name='person's will create a request.values|['person']

form = dict (request.values)

# Convert all values into a dictionary

person = form["person"]

B Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
HTTPS is the secure version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is designed to ensure
communication is encrypted between the client and server to help protect against man-in-the-

middle attacks and eavesdroppers. There are three key features that HTTPS offers over the
original HTTP:
B Encryption: typically achieved through the use of either SSL or TLS encryption methods.
B Authentication: a digitally signed certificate is issued by the server so your client
application can verity it is connecting to the correct server (i.e. to protect against an
imposter posing as your bank website, for instance).
B Data integrity: ensures that the data sent and received is not altered in transit.
These ideas are discussed further in Sectrion A2.4.4.

DHCPACK (unicast or broadcast)

o

DHCP is a network-management protocol. It is used most commonly when a computer first
joins a computer network (for example on system start-up). DIICP is the process by which the

computer requests and receives a valid IP address for use on that network. In many home and
small office networks, the device commonly known as the “router” also runs a DIICP server on
it, providing IP addresses to devices that connect to it within the home.
The client device broadcasts (that is, sends a message for all devices on the network to see) a
DIICP Discover message in which it provides its hardware MAC address and any preferences
regarding subnet, router, DNS server or IP address lease time.
A DIHCP server responds with a DIICP Offer message to assign an IP address from within
a defined pool of addresses available to it. IP addresses are “leased” to devices for a specific
period, after which the device must request to renew its lease. This process allows for
reconfiguration and reuse of addresses. The offer also includes information about subnet,
domain name server and other matters.

In the home or small office space, there are a number of addresses that have been reserved
for private internal nerworks to use. These addresses are not used by valid servers and are not
routable on the public internet. These address ranges are:
A2 Networks

m

172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

B

192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Networks that use these addresses for their internal devices rely on services such as network
address translation to connect to the public internet. See Section A2.3.1 for a discussion

The TCF/IP model is broken down into the four layers:

the network interface layer (also known as the “physical

-

layer™), the internet layer, the transport layer and, finally,
the application layer.

Ml Application
The application layer is the topmost level and is where the
Network

protocols used by actual applications reside. They include

iitetfacallavey

applications such as HTTP and HTTPS for web browsing;
FTP for file transfer; SMTP and POP3 for email; and DNS.

M The allocation of bits in the TCP and UDP protocols.

The application is responsible for using and correctly

forming messages transmitted through these protocols.

Hl Transport
On initiation of a communication request from an application, the operating system uses the

transport layer to help ensure the data gets from the correct source application to the correct
target application at the destination.

The two primary protocols that reside in the transport layer are TCP (Transport Control
Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
The transport layer receives data from the application layer, segments it and handles error

detection and correction (if using TCP), along with retransmitting lost packets.
These segments or datagrams are then transferred to the internet layer.

B Internet
.

The internet layer is responsible for managing the
movement of packets across the network, including

‘

Source IP address

’

ensuring they are routed to the correct destination.

To do this, it receives segmented data from the transport
layer, encapsulates it into packets and decides on the best

Destination IP address

route for the packets to travel across networks. These
packets are then forwarded to the network interface layer,
which takes care of transmitting the bits to the next

ATNO TH

M Network interface
The network interface layer manages the process of physical transmission of the data across
the networking hardware and transmission media. It includes the protocols and hardware

necessary to deliver the data across the local media, and aspects such as Ethernet, WiFi and
physical network components including routers, cabling and switches.
The network interface layer receives data packets trom the internet layer and converts them
into a form suitable for transmission over the network, such as over Ethernet cabling or WiFi.
Hardware addressing, such as MAC addresses, is managed by this layer.

(.-Common mistake
It's common to confuse which protocols operate at which layer of the TCP/IP model. Keep a clear

needed for the various devices that are connecting.

A few factors to consider with the star topology include:
Reliability: If the central device fails, the network fails.
Bandwidth speed: While each device has its own dedicated connection to the hub, the
overall throughput speed is dependent on the processing capacity of that central hub.
Scalability: The central switch typically has a limited number of ports or connections that
it can handle, possibly limiring expansion to accommodate future needs.
Collisions: There is minimal risk of data collision as every node has its own

dedicated connection.
Cost: Quite low if only a few nodes are needed; however, costs can increase if the capacity
limits of the central node are exceeded and upgrades are required.

(.-Tup tip!
Each topology (star, mesh, hybrid) serves different needs. Be sure to understand why each one is
more suitable than another for specific situations. Learn the diagrams of the different topologies to
visualize how nodes are connected, as that provides a crudial understanding of how the flow of data
is impacted if a node fails.

Bl Mesh topology
In a mesh topology, every node has an immediate, direct connection to every other node.
While most often depicted as a full mesh, partial meshes do also exist.
Meshes are suitable for large environments where reliability of individual pathways may be a
concern. Critical infrastructure, such as military and aviation environments, is more inclined to

use a mesh topology to help ensure robust resilience of the network against any point of failure.
Wireless mesh systems, such as Meshtastic, have also started
to gain popularity among tech hobbyists and as a means of
providing connectivity in remote and disaster-prone areas.

Factors worth considering in a mesh environment include:
B Reliability: Highly reliable and robust against the

1
o

failure of any individual node or communication path.

B Bandwidth speed: High, given that each node can
communicate directly with its intended target node.

m

Scalability: Adding new nodes is expensive as cabling
and infrastructure must be run to all other nodes on
the network.

B Collisions: Minimal risk of collisions due to the direct
connections available.

m

Cost: High due to all the additional cabling and
networking infrastructure required for all the
redundant connections.

M In a mesh topology, all nodes are interconnected to all
other nodes

A2 Networks

H Hybrid topology
The hybrid topology combines a mix of two or more other topologies. It makes maximum use
of the advantages of each approach while minimizing the downsides. Hybrid approaches are
suitable for large enterprises and telecommunications networks. In the illustration, a mesh

A2.2.2 The function of servers (HL)
=
=

(;Top tip!
It is very common for one physical computer acting as a server to have many server-based
applications running on it simultaneously. The one computer could have a web server on port 80
and 443; an FTP server on 20 and 21; an SSH server running on port 22; and a DNS server on 53.
In this section, “server” relates more to the separate server software applications rather than

separate physical devices.

# Server: a computer

Typically, these are dedicated machines housed in a specialized room, centrally located on the
network with backup power supplies and other systems.
This section looks at some of the common application servers frequently seen on networks. We
will look at each from a perspecrive of their function, scalability, reliability and securiry.

The domain name server provides a translation service that converts human-readable domain

names into the IP addresses that are required for routing purposes. For example, at the time of

device connects to the network. If the DNS server that receives the request does not know the
answer to the query, it asks its DNS server, and so on up the chain until a server can provide a
response. The DNS server then typically caches that response for a while in case it receives the

same query.
On Windows computers, the nslookup terminal command allows you to execute DNS

queries, and on macOS machines use the host command. In Python, there is a built-in dns .
resolver module that you can use.

Python
import dnspython as dns
import dns.resolver
domain = "www.example.com"
try:

resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
answer = resolver.resolve(domain,

"A")

for record in answer:
print (record.to text()
except dns.resclver. NXDOMAIN:

print (£"The domain {domain} does not exist.")
except dns.resolver.Timeout:

print (£"The DNS lookup for {domain} timed out."
except dns.resolver.NoAnswer:

print (£"No answer found for {domain}.")
except Exception as e:

print (£"An error occurred:

{e}")

B Scalability: DNS uses a distributed database and caching,. This system allows for the global
domain name system to manage with ease the billions of requests made per day.
B Reliability: DNS is a mission-critical system for the internet. Any downtime, particularly
from the upstream servers, can affect many thousands or millions of client devices. With
that in mind, the system is built with a lot of redundancy in place, where each server
typically has at least three alternatives to query.
B Security: Given the global importance of DNS, it is frequently the subject of malicious
behaviour. The key domain name servers around the world require extremely

robust security systems including firewalls, intrusion detection systems and
other countermeasures.

Bl Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
As previously discussed in Section A2.1.4, DHCP is responsible for assigning TP addresses and
network settings to devices that request them on the network.

M File server
A file server provides a centralized location to store, access and manage files. There are several
commonly used approaches for this.
FTP (file transfer protocol) or SFTP (secure FTP) are protocols that are commonly used for
accessing remote systems for the transfer of files. FTP usually involves opening dedicated FTP
transfer utility software to perform the task.
A2 Networks

For an office environment, it is usually preferential for the storage of a file server to be present
within the file, folder and disk structure of the local computer operating system as a mounted
drive letter (Windows) or folder (macOS). To do this, protocols such as Server Message Block

(SMB), Network File System (NFS) or Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) are more commonly used.
B Scalability: File servers are typically scaled through adding drives to provide additional

storage, and upgrading the speed of the network interface cards when they are shared
between many client devices.
B Reliability: RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a technology that allows tor
combining multiple physical disk drives into one logical unit. This can be used to pool the

storage together to create one larger drive (for example two 1 TB drives pooled together to
present as if they were a 2 TB drive), or to provide backup redundancy in the case of one

drive failing. RAID also allows for a hybrid approach to mix both functions together.
B Security: Access permissions need to be carefully managed to protect against unauthorized
access or alteration of data. These access permissions can typically be set at a file or folder
level, and can have either read-only permission or read—write permission.

B Mail server
The mail server stores emails for local users on a network, and exchanges them with other
mail servers when users send an email. Commonly used protocols include the SMTP (Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol) and POP3 (Post Office Protocol).

B Scalability: Mail servers need to handle large volumes of emails and attachments
efficiently. Many companies contract out their mail systems to third-party providers to help

manage the demand.
B Reliability: As a critical system, email servers typically employ such mechanisms as queues

and redundant systems to help maintain reliability.
B Security: Strong security systems for email are essential, given the frequency with which
email is used as an attack vector for spam, phishing, pharming, malware attachments and
other security threats. Best practice now involves the use of email authentication protocols
such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DomainKeys Identitied Mail (DKIM). SPF

allows domain name owners to specify which email servers are authorized to send emails

on their behalf. DKIM allows domain name owners to sign their emails digitally with a
cryptographic signature that can be checked by the recipient to ensure the email has not

been tampered with en route.

B Proxy server
In the business and commercial world of contracts, a proxy
is a person you authorize to act on your behalf.
In that vein, a proxy server is traditionally used to act
as the client device on your behalf to browse the greater

internet. Its caching functionality is useful as it means it
can remember content for you from different addresses and
/

return that request immediately without having to generate
additional external traffic. Organizations such as schools

and offices may use a proxy server for requests coming
from their internal network to reduce costs. As the request

the proxy and not the actual client, students may also use proxy servers installed on computers
at home as a means of getting around school network filters.
Proxy servers can also be configured to act on behalf of the server rather than just client

devices. This arrangement is known as a “reverse proxy”. This arrangement is typically used to
help distribute the load of incoming requests among a range of servers, and also to cache the

common responses given to save calculation and processing load on the servers themselves.
W Scalability: Reverse proxy configurations can dramatically improve the scalability of a web
server to handle signiticantly more traffic than would otherwise be the case.
B Reliability: When used to balance loads, a proxy server provides fault tolerance capacity.
B Security: A proxy server provides an additional layer of security by shielding internal client
devices from direct exposure to the internet.

B Web server
A web server hosts web pages and related content, and serves them to client devices across
the internet. The web pages can either be static documents (such as HTML) or dynamically
produced at runtime from programming code, in which case the web server sends the
request to the application in the style of a reverse proxy, and then sends the reply back to the
original client.
Nginx is a popular open source web server.
B Scalability: Modern web servers are quite efficient but, when demand for their services is
high, the load is typically distributed across mulriple servers, with a reverse proxy server
acting as the public interface.
B Reliability: If the web server fails, then all websites it is hosting also fail. As web-based
applications become critical infrastructure for some organizations, the importance of
reliable web server software grows.
B Security: A web server needs to be secured against attacks such as distributed denial of
service. Additionally, modern web servers provide encryption and authentication through
SSL to run HTTPS, rather than just HTTP trattic, for a sater browsing experience. Let’s
Encrypt (https:/letsencrypt.org) provides a {ree service for obtaining the SSL certificates
needed to offer HTTPS browsing through a web server.

A2.2.3 Networking models
H Client-server
The client—server model is where devices take on the role of either being the client that
requests a network service, or the server that provides a network service.
Benefits:
B Centralized control: It is easier to manage and update systems from a central point.
W Scalability: It is easier to add a more powerful server (for example with increased
processing, memory or storage) if it is a central system.
Efficiency: A server can be optimized for a specific task.
Security: It is much easier to manage security risks if everything is run from a central point.

A2 Networks

Drawbacks:
m Single point of failure: If the server goes down, all services attached to it fail.
B Single point of risk: If the security of the server is compromised, all data and services
managed by the central point are also exposed and vulnerable.
B

Cost: Creating a central point to manage all the requests means a significant investment in
expensive hardware and software to cope with that demand.

Real-world applications:

B Web browsing: Clients (browsers) request web pages from servers.
B Email: Email servers manage the sending and receiving of emails to and from

client applications.
B Online banking: Central servers handle transactions, authentication and data storage,
offering high security and reliability.

@

B Peer-to-peer
In the peer-to-peer model, there is no server that co-ordinates the network services; each
device is both a client and a server, and communicates with all other peers. The provision of

network services is distributed across the devices.
The challenge with peer-to-peer is co-ordination, since there is no obvious “authoritative”

source to query where to find certain services.
/
.

\

Benefits:
&

m Decentralization: There is no single point of failure or risk.
m

Cost effective: There is no need to spend money on expensive hardware or software, as the
load is shared among all the clients themselves.

B Scalability: As the size of the network grows, so too does the scale of services it can
provide. Each additional peer also adds additional capacity.
B Direct sharing: Services can be provided directly from one computer to another,
reducing hottlenecks.

Drawbacks:
B

Co-ordinarion: Maintaining settings, security patches and synchronization of data across

multiple nodes on the network can be very challenging.
B Reliability: Since services are being provided by peers, which are just client devices on the
network, if someone turns their device off, then it is no longer providing whatever services

it was supplying to the network. Availability of systems and resources on the network can
vary without much notice.

(‘Common mistake
Networking models
Don't oversimplify the distinction between client-server and peer-to-peer models. Understand the
nuances involved that might make one more suitable than the other for specific scenarios. Failing
to consider scalability and maintenance aspects can lead to incomplete understandings.

A2.2 Network architecture

Real-world applications:
® BitTorrent: Files are shared directly between users without a co-ordinated central hub.
B Voice over IP: The data for calls and video conferencing are routed directly from client to
client, rather than creating massive data bottlenecks for a centralized server.
B Blockchain: Bitcoin and other blockchains operate decentralized databases across many
nodes to help guard against tampering with the transacrion ledger.

A2.2.4 Concepts and applications

of network segmentation
Network segmentation refers to logically splitting a larger network into smaller, more

# Network

manageable parts. Each of these segments can be isolated from each other to provide better

a computer network

security, performance or management of system resources.

into smaller, distinct
subnetworks to improve
performance, security
and management.

Two commonly used approaches for network segmentation are subnetting and virtual local
area networks (VLANSs).

Subnetting divides a network into subnetworks based on unique ranges of IP addresses. For
instance, a school may place statf devices on 192.168.0.X, and student devices on 192.168.1.X.
Each subnet can share the same networking infrastructure, such as wireless access points,
switches and cabling, but would not “see” the devices on the alternate subnet. This approach
allows devices to be logically grouped based on department, function or geography, and can
allow for different security policies to be applied, depending on the organization’s needs.

Virtual LANs are another way of separating one physical network into two logical networks
without requiring duplication of infrastructure. They create distinct broadcast domains that
are mutually isolated unless explicitly allowed to communicate via routing. Traffic is isolated
to members of the VLAN only. Where a client device may change its subnet by manually
changing its IP address, VLANs are more secure and typically use MAC addresses or login
credentials to determine which VLAN a device gets connected to. Because a virtual LAN is a
logical construct rather than a physical one, it is worth noting that a VLAN could extend over
numerous physical networks (such as over a VPN link).

Whichever method is used, segmentation reduces overall network traffic within each segment,
allowing for more efficient data transmission. Network congestion for high bandwidth

applications can be contained to an individual network segment, resulting in the other
segments within the network being unaftfected. Security is also significantly enhanced, as

visibility of servers and their services can be restricted to particular VLANs.

(‘Common mistake
Network segmentation
Mixing up segmentation, subnetting and VLANs is common. Make sure you define and distinguish
each clearly.

IR T

The key difference between IP version 4 and version 6 is the size of the address space. IPv6 was
designed to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 addresses running out.
IPv4 uses a four-byte or 32-bit address, which is why it is typically displayed as four
numbers separated by dots, where each number is in the range of a byte, 0-255, for example
192.168.0.1. Given there are 2% possible addresses using these numbers, it means IPv4 is
limited to approximately 4,300,000,000 nodes on the network.

A2 Networks

TPv6, on the other hand, uses 16 bytes or 128 bits for its addresses. These addresses are

typically displayed as eight groups of four bytes written in hexadecimal form, such as

2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. Having 2" addresses equates to a
capacity for a staggering 340,282 ,370,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 nodes.

M Public and private addresses
The key difference between public and private addresses is their visibility on the public internet.

TP addresses that are used on the public internet must be globally unique. They are typically
assigned to websites, external-facing servers and routers that connect to the internet. The

allocation of these public internet addresses is managed by ICANN (the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers).
Private IP addresses used within a private network are not directly routable on the global
internet. They are commonly used in home and corporate networks for devices such as

computers, tablets and internal servers. Traffic from these devices must be converted to a
public address by the router to get on to the public internet.
ICANN has reserved certain ranges of addresses as private, non-routable addresses for
organizations to use for their internal networks. These are:
m

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

m

172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

FDFF-FFFEFFFEFFFEFFFEFFFT:-FEFFF-FFTE

B Static and dynamic addresses
Static IP addresses are those that are permanently assigned to a device. The device uses the
same IP address every time it connects to the network. Static IP addresses are essential for
servers so that client devices know where to locate them on a network.
In contrast, a dynamic IP address is one that is assigned to a device when it connects to the

network. This process is overseen by a DHCP server that allocates connecting devices an
address from a predetermined pool of addresses that it has available to it. Dynamic addresses
help reduce overheads by more efficiently utilizing a limited number of IP addresses in
environments where devices frequently connect and disconnect.

A2 .3 Data transmissions

B Network address translation (NAT)
.
(;Top tlp!

Network address translation
Make sure you have an appreciation of, and recognize the role of, network address translation
(NAT). Its capacity to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single IP address for
internet communications has kept the internet as a viable, functioning system. Its role in conserving
global IP address space cannot be overstated.
Network address translation is a process whereby networks translate private 1P addresses to

public IP addresses, and vice versa. The process enables multiple devices on a network to share
a single public IP address.

NAT has been crucial for the effective operation of the internet as it still remains highly
dependent on IPv4 addresses, which have been all but exhausted. It also helps provide an
additional layer of security for home and small office networks by hiding internal IP addresses

from the external network.

A2.3.2 Types of media for data transmission
(;Tup tip!
Side by side
Create a side-by-side comparison table for fibre-optic, twisted-pair and wireless media, with a focus
on bandwidth, cost and installation complexity. Consider the roles for each type, such as fibre optic
in data centres, twisted pair in offices and wireless for campuses, homes and mobile set-ups. Pay
special attention to how security varies across the different media, particularly the susceptibility to
eavesdropping or interference.

M Fibre-optic cabling
Advantages:
B Bandwidth: Fibre optic has the highest data-transmission rates of the media under
consideration in this section. Active research continues to make it even better, but current

technology already allows for terabits per second to be transmitted.
® Interference susceptibility: As tibre-optic cabling uses light waves to transmit data, it is not
susceptible to electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for environments with electrical
noise, such as that generated by motors.
B Range and attenuation: Fibre-optic cabling is the medium of choice for the intercontinental
submarine cables that run across the ocean floor, due to its very low signal loss over long

distances. Commercially available single-mode fibre-optic cables can easily run distances of
tens or hundreds of kilometres before a repeater is required.
B Security: Fibre-optic cables are very difficult to “tap” without detection, making them an
excellent option where security is a concern.
Disadvantages:
® Cost: Fibre-optic cables are generally more expensive than other forms of cabling, both
with respect to the cabling materials and supporting hardware infrastructure and the
installation labour time.
B Reliability: Fibre-optic cables are more fragile than metallic cables and are prone to damage
it improperly handled. Specifically, they have a limited radius tor the maximum bend they
can safely operate under.
B Installation complexity: The issues regarding supporting infrastructure requirements and
proper handling of the cables themselves tend to result in fibre-optic cables requiring more
specialized skills and equipment for installarion and maintenance operarions.

A2 Networks

M Twisted-pair cabling
Advantages:
Cost: Twisted-pair cabling has been a well-known and established technology for decades
now. It is widely and cheaply available.
Installation complexity: Installation is considerably less complex than for fibre optic.
A do-it-yourself approach is frequently taken for installation of simple home and small
office networks, with telephony technicians typically only required for outdoor and other

complex environments.
Reliability: The cables are vastly more flexible, meaning they can be safely and reliably
installed into tight spaces.
Disadvantages:

Bandwidth: Twisted-pair cabling is typically an order of magnitude slower than the
equivalent in fibre optic. That said, it is still quite adequate for most home and small

office arrangements, offering Gigabit bandwidth performance. Twisted-pair cabling
also significantly outperforms wireless nerworks. The highest quality twisted-pair cable
currently available — Category 7 Ethernet — is rated for speeds of up to 10 Gb/s.
Interference susceptibility: Given it is a cable that uses electrical signals to transmit
data, twisted-pair cabling is quite susceptible to electromagnetic interference from the
surrounding environment. This is particularly the case where shielding has not been
wrapped around the cables.
Range and attenuation: The range of twisted pair is considerably less than fibre optic.
Category 6a twisted-pair Fthernet cables typically only have a range of approximarely
100 metres.

Security: As it is easier to tap into than fibre-optic cables, twisted pair poses a more

significant security risk; however, an attacker must still get in close physical proximity to
the cable, unlike with wireless.

B Wireless transmission
Advantages:
Installation complexity: There are no physical cables, so installation complexity and cost
are significantly lower than for physical cable media.

Cost: Wireless networks can be a cost-effective means of covering a large area where
cabling is not practical.
Reliability: Wireless networks provide mobility for devices to connect from, whatever
the location, provided it is within the signal range. That said, reliability can be impacted

through radio interference, discussed below.
Disadvantages:
Bandwidth: In practical scenarios, the total available bandwidth is shared among
connected devices, so the individual device throughput varies based on network conditions
and the number of devices connected. Typically, a total bandwidth capacity of several

Gh/s is available for the devices to share. This is lower than the equivalent twisted pair
or fibre optic, and these also come with their own dedicated bandwidth, rather than a

shared connection.
Interference susceptibility: Wireless is very susceptible to interference from other wireless
or radio signals, and physical obstructions can significantly aftect signal quality.

waves, it excites the water molecules in your food, which causes it to heat up.
WiFi technology is considered safe to use, even though it also relies on 2.4 GHz, as the strength
of the radio signals is measured in milliwatts, as opposed to most microwave ovens, which are

pumping 800 to 1000 watts of energy into the surrounding environment.
B Range and attenuation: Range is typically limited to a maximum of about 90 metres in
clear, line-of-sight conditions. Strength and quality of the signal deteriorate with distance
and physical obstructions, such as walls.
B Security: Wireless technologies have a long and complicated history of being security
risks since an attacker does not have to be physically present at a network connection to
intercept the signal. Often, attackers can sit in a car outside the home or office and collect
all your WiFi signals over the air. A lot of effort has been made to add layers of encryption

to modern WiFi to mitigate this problem, but risks still exist.

A2.3.3 Packet switching
(;Top tip!
Account for packet loss
4 Packet switching: a
methad of sending data
in small blocks, known
as “packets”, across a

network. Fach packet
can take a different path
to reach its destination.

When considering the workload associated with packet switching and routing, be sure to
remember that not all data transmitted is received at the other end. The seeming reliability of

the modern internet is actually only due to all the error checking that occurs behind the scenes
accounting for packet loss. This can have a significant impact on the performance of a network,
espedially where electromagnetic or other interference sources may abound.
Packet switching is the foundation of most modern networking technologies, including the
internet. It involves breaking large pieces of data into smaller, more manageable chunks called

“packets”. These packets are transmitted across the network independently of each other and
reassembled into the original whole at the destination. Packet switching is a highly scalable
tool that allows efficient use of network resources, in contrast to older technologies such as

circuit switching, where an entire dedicated channel or cable was used for the duration of a
communication session (which deprived other devices of being able to use it).

broken into smaller pieces known as “packets”. These packets contain a chunk of the data,
plus information known as the “header” that contains source and destination network
addresses and other control information. The MTU (maximum transmission unit) size of a

packet is typically 1500 bytes, including header information.

A2 Networks

m

Packet header: The header of each packet contains information that helps ensure the
efficient and reliable transmission of the packet across the network, such as the source
and destination 1P addresses. Additionally, each packet contains a sequence number that
is used to reorder the packets at the destination into their correct sequence, so that the

content of the data file is not jumbled. The header also contains error-checking information
such as checksums, which calculate whether the packet has arrived correctly, or whether
the source has to be asked to retransmit it.

B Routing: Each packet is sent through the computer network independently of any of the
other packets associated with it. This means that packets for the same file may travel
different paths across the network, based on conditions such as congestion and route
availability. This flexibility in routing helps networks oprimize usage and provide for a
robust environment that is more tolerant of failures within the network.
B Routers: These devices determine the optimal path for each packet passing through to

reach its destination. They inspect the packet destination address and use routing tables
and algorithms to decide the next hop in the network to forward each packet to.

m Switches: These devices are typically operated within local area networks and direct
packets between devices on the same network. They use the MAC addresses to process and

forward packets.
B Reassembly: Once the packet has reached its destination, it is checked for sequencing
information and then reassembled into the original file in the correct order. Importantly,
because no two packets are guaranteed to be transmitted along the same path, it is
impossible to assume that packets have arrived in the correct order. Addirionally, some
packets may have been lost or corrupted in transmission, so the source needs to be
requested to retransmit those packets.

A2.3.4 Static routing and dynamic
routing in local area networks (HL)
# Routing: the process
of selecting paths
along a computer
network to send
network traffic, based

on the routing table,
network performance
and protocols.

Network routing refers to the algorithms that determine the path for traffic in a network, or
between and across multiple networks. Within local area networks, rouring decisions can be
handled by one of two methods: static or dynamic routing.

Static routing
Static routing is where the network routes are manually configured and entered into a rouring
table by the network administrator. These routes do not change except by manual update.
This method is easy to implement in small networks where the routes do not change much,

but can be too complex to manage in networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes. Static
routing provides predictability in the behaviour of your network, and does not require
additional processing or bandwidth due to one router communicating with another for route
discovery and optimizarion.

In addition to the challenge of scale, other issues around static routing include the lack of
fault tolerance as, if a connection fails, static routing does not automatically attempt to find a

workaround; and the maintenance workload associated with it, as every small change in the
network requires manual updating of the routing table.

l Dynamic routing
As can likely be inferred, dynamic routing contrasts
with static routing by using an algorithmic approach to

R4

automatically adjust routes in the routing table. To do this,

routers communicate with each other to share information
R2

about their connections, topology and demand on their
network resources. This information is used to adjust the
routes in runtime, with the goal of ensuring optimal paths
for network efficiency.

R1

Dynamic routing scales well for larger networks, as they can
automatically adapt as changes occur. This also improves
fault tolerance, as network tratfic can be automatically rerouted around a failed connection.
Dynamic routing does pose some challenges. Its dynamic

nature requires additional computational and bandwidth
resources to manage. The combinartion of the larger

networks and the dynamic routing do make for a more
complex routing table that needs to be configured and

maintained. This necessitates a deeper understanding of
network concepts by the staff maintaining such a nerwork.
Finally, given each router is maintaining its own copy of
a rouring table, there can be delays in the convergence of
the routing table while the individual routers communicate
and negotiate with each other. This can lead to occasional

M Firewall in action

A firewall inspects the IP packets that pass through it, and filters the incoming and outgoing
traffic, based on a set of predefined security rules. In the illustration above, Rule 1 is allowing
traffic from PC2 on the internal LAN to access any external IP address that begins with
185.2.2.2 for destination ports 80 or 443. Rule 2 then denies all other internal requests. Each
individual packet is checked against the rules until a rule is encountered that allows or denies
passage through the firewall.
Some firewalls are also capable of applying stateful inspection, where the state of active
connections is monitored and can be used to determine passage through the firewall, for
instance once a connection has been allowed to be established, packets are allowed to continue
back and forth through the connection until it closes.

A2 Networks

The rules comprise a set of allow lists and deny lists. These lists are IP addresses or ranges of
1P addresses, and optionally can also specify application port numbers.
Using the rule lists, firewalls control access to the internal network from external sources, and
can also be used to control which external destinations are accessible from internal sources.
Addirtionally, firewalls log traffic requests, which can be useful for detecting and responding to

suspicious activity or for identifying a potential breach.
Firewalls are just one tool for securing a network, and are not perfect for protecting against
all types of attacks. For instance, firewalls are less effective against threats from within the
network such as a malicious insider, or if an external threat has gained local presence on

the network via compromised WiFi. Some threats can be quite sophisticated and can mimic
legitimate traffic. Finally, a firewall is only as good as its configuration. If a network manager

doesn't keep the deny lists updated and the firewall firmware up to date, then vulnerabilities
can be exposed.

(;Cummon mistake
Over-reliance on firewalls
Don't assume that a firewall alone is sufficient to protect a computer network. Firewalls are
gatekeepers for ranges of addresses and ports. Most firewalls do not inspect the content of the
data beyond the source and destination address and port, meaning malicious data can easily still
be let through if destined for a legitimate location.

B Network address translation in action

You were previously introduced to the concept of network address translation in Section A2.3.1.
Beyond the convenience that network address translation has provided through allowing the
internet to continue to function despite having exhausted IPv4 addresses years ago, it has also
had an additional benefit with respect to network security.
Since NAT modifies the IP address information in packet headers, the process helps to hide
internal TP addresses on a network, which makes it more difficult for an external attacker
to reach internal systems. Although it is not technically a security feature by design, it does

provide an additional layer of difficulty that attackers must overcome, as the internal structure
of your network and IP addresses are not directly exposed. In this sense, it could be described

as a case of security by obscurity.
A2 .4 Network security

In this section, we briefly consider a range of common attack vectors and vulnerabilities within
computer networks. In the subsequent section, we review strategies to mitigate these risks.

Out D-f resources

Service offline

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which multiple systems under the

control of the malicious actor generate a massive number of network requests, with the goal
of overwhelming the target system. This can cause the target to slow down, so that it becomes

unusable or unavailable for legitimate users.
It is important to point out that the computers being used for the attack are typically not even

devices directly owned or operated by the attacker. It is more likely that they are devices that
have fallen victim to having unwittingly installed malware on their system that the attacker
can then use to contribute towards the overall DDoS attack.

B Insecure network protocols
There are many older or poorly designed network protocols still in widespread use that do not

include modern security features. These older protocols allow attackers to intercept, or even
alter and manipulate, the content of darta in transit on the internet.

Examples of these older protocols are HTTP, FTP and Telnet, all of which transmit their data in
the clear without any form of encryption. The modern alternatives are HTTPS, SFTP and SSH.

B Malware
“Malware”, or “malicious software”, is the overarching term for a classic range of attacks that
have had various names applied to them over the years. If you've come across terms such as
“computer viruses”, “worms”, “trojan horses” and “ransomware”, these are all various forms
of malware. They are software that is designed to harm or exploit vulnerable devices and to

seck out and spread to other vulnerable devices. They can lead to data loss, data theft and loss
of full control of the device. Malware can sometimes sit idle for extended periods of time until

triggered to activate (such as in the case of a DDoS client).

Man in the middle

A man-in-the-middle attack (now also sometimes referred to as an on-path attack) is where an

attacker eavesdrops on communications between two systems.
This can result in data breaches, or darta alteration, without the knowledge of the original

parties involved.

H Phishing
Phishing is when a victim receives, and responds to, a seemingly legitimate message (such as

an email) that has the aim of deceiving the victim into providing sensitive information, such
as login credentials or bank account details. This can result in unauthorized access to other

systems, identity theft and financial crimes.

M SQL injection
An SQL injection is where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the way an application or
website has been designed to work with its database. It relies upon the programmers not
applying sufficient validation checks to the user inputs, so that the application can make
unintended changes to the underlying database. This can result in unauthorized viewing
of user lists (and their passwords), deletion of data or granting administrative control of the

database to the attacker.
To understand how the SQL injection attack works, consider the impact the following Python
would have to the SQL statement if executed on a database:
|

ATNO TH

Never trust inputs from users or feed them straight into your database without verifying and
validating them first!

B Cross site scripting (XSS)
Cross site scripting attacks operate on similar principles to the SQL injection attack. Instead of
using insufficient validation to send rogue database instructions, a cross site scripting attacker
injects their own code to run client-side on pages viewed by other users. This can bypass
access controls, deface websites or redirect users to malicious sites.
Any website that loads and executes JavaScript that is being hosted by a third party (a very

common practice for many JavaScript libraries) makes itself potentially vulnerable to this
scenario, as the website is effectively inviting the third party to run their own code on
the website.

B Unpatched software
Unpatched software refers to software that has not had all published security updates applied

to it. Once security updates are released by software vendors, it is particularly important to
apply them as soon as possible as not only do they help address and correct a vulnerability,

they also advertise the existence of the vulnerability, making devices lacking the update even
more vulnerable to artack.

B Weak authentication
Systems that have poorly designed authentication systems make themselves vulnerable to
attack by design. Examples of this might be websites that do not properly hash and salt their
passwords, or that store their security keys in insecure folders. Multifactor authentication
systems, and the use of tools such as OAuth, are industry standard for a reason.

Developers should be discouraged from rolling out their own authentication system
for anything other than as a learning tool. Use and rely on the excellent high-quality

authentication systems that have been built upon the tears of those who have gone before you.

B Zero-day exploits
A zero-day exploit is when an attacker takes advantage of a previously unknown weakness

in software or hardware, before its maintainers have had the opportunity to create a patch to
fix the vulnerability. These types of exploits are especially dangerous because, by their very
nature, there is no known defence against them.
Perhaps the best-known historical example of a zero-day exploit was Stuxnet. It was malware

that was used to break into Iran’s uranium-enrichment centrifuges in 2006, and is suspected to
have been created by the USA’s National Security Agency (NSA).

A2 Networks

A2.4.3 Common network countermeasures (HL)
(;Common mistake
Network security is more than having anti-malware software and using encryption
Many times, when students are asked how to protect a computer or data on a network, they
simply revert to saying “install anti-malware software” or “use encryption”. These are lazy
answers that do not capture the nuance of the approaches outlined in this section. Network

security requires a complex, multi-layered approach to protect against attacks. Be sure to
understand the different strategies outlined and be prepared to discuss them in assessmenits.

(;Top tip!
Match the threat to the countermeasure
One method of ensuring you master a more detailed understanding of the complexities of
securing a computer network is to review the various threats discussed in the previous section, and
match each to the appropriate countermeasure discussed in this section. For instance, multifactor

authentication can help counter weak authentication issues.

l Content security policies
The content security policy header is settings that can be placed into the HTTP header to
define which sources are permitted to load content on to a particular website. Properly set,
they can help guard against XSS attacks and similar injection exploits.
Tor more informarion, search online for Mozilla’s content-security-policy documentation
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).

Bl Complex password policies
Password policies are continually a vexed and contentious issue.
Some in the industry continue to argue for password rules that enforce the creation of strong,
hard-to-brute-force passwords that require minimum lengths and a mix of letters, numbers
and special characters.
Others in the industry argue that best practice should be to help users cope with what is
described as “password overload”. Security experts such as Troy Hunt argue best practice

should entail:
B only using passwords where they are really needed
B using technical solutions to reduce the burden on users

m allowing users to securely record and store their passwords
B only asking users to change their passwords on suspicion of compromise
B allowing users to reset passwords easily, quickly and cheaply.
Tor more on modern understanding of password policies, search online for Troy Hunt’s
excellent article “Passwords Evolved: Authentication Guidance for the Modern Era”
(www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era).

Major companies such as Microsoft and Google are now promoting the use of passwordless
authentication as much as possible. As Google states: “Developers and users both hate
passwords: they give a poor user experience, they add conversion triction, and they create
security liability for both users and developers.”
Passkeys are being promoted as a safer and easier alternative. This can take one of a variety of

forms, including:
B biometric sensor login (fingerprint or face recognition)
m PIN

B pattern.
Read more about passkeys by searching online for Google Developer’s “Passwordless login
with passkeys” (https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys).

If you do use a website that still requires a password, be concerned if it imposes a maximum
length on the password you set. If a password is properly hashed, it won't matter how long

itis, so if you are told by a system that the password has a maximum length, chances are it
means they are storing it in unhashed clear text! Run, run far away, and definitely do not
reuse a “real” password on that service! (The author has been known to use variations of
“thisPasswordIsNotSecure” on such websites @)

B Distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation tools
To help guard a server against a DDoS attack, most firewalls and web servers have settings
available that help absorb or deflect traffic overloads. They do this by rate limiting (allowing
a maximum number of requests in a given time-period from any individual source), traffic
analysis and also subscribing to cloud-based DDoS protection services, such as those provided
by the major cloud-hosting companies.

B Email filtering solutions
One of the most common attack vectors used for the spread of malicious software remains
email. To this end, having modern and up-to-date email-filtering systems to scan incoming
emails for malicious attachments, phishing attempts and general marketing spam can go a long
way to protect end-users from email-based threats.

B Encrypted protocols
To protect against man-in-the-middle and other similar attacks is trivially easy now. Simply
do not use unencrypted protocols such as HTTP, FTP or Telnet. Only use systems that
accommodate the secure, encrypted modern versions of HTTPS, SFTP or SSH.

B Input validation
A maxim in Computer Science is never to trust user inputs: always validate them!
Use a range of input-validation tools, such as presence check, length check, type check and
format check to validate that the structure of the incoming data is in the style and format
expected. For instance, your software shouldn’t be accepting kilobytes of data when the entry
box is for a person’s name or date of birth!
A few simple checks on the input data being received from the user, prior to accepting and
processing it, goes a long way to protecting systems from harmful data.
An example of where lack of input validation caused global security concerns was the
Heartbleed vulnerability that was hidden within the important OpenSSL cryptography library,
which is a widely used implementation of the transport layer security protocol.

A2 Networks

For a simplified look at how the artack worked, search online for “*1354: Heartbleed

Explanation” (www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1354:_Heartbleed_Explanation).

B Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion
prevention systems (IPS)
Intrusion detection and prevention systems are specialized software tools that actively monitor

network traffic and the broader state of your system. Their goal is not just to detect potential
threats, but proactively to block them before they succeed in compromising your systems.
The intrusion detection system focuses on monitoring network and system traffic to spot
suspicious activities and potential threats. It sends alerts to network administrators when it
identities such activity. The IDS is a passive system, meaning that it does not interfere with the
flow of traffic on the system.
The intrusion prevention system is an active system. When it detects a threat, it takes proactive
measures to prevent the threat from gaining access to, or harming, the network. It can block
traffic, drop malicious packets, close connections and more.

In modern cybersecurity solutions, the IDS and IPS roles are often bundled together into a
comprehensive security product, allowing for both detection of threats and active measures

to prevent those threats from causing harm. These modern tools have taken on the name
of “endpoint protection” to describe their role. Endpoint-protection software typically also
bundles other security functions, such as antivirus, anti-malware, firewalls and others, with
the goal of integration being to provide a robust protection regime.
Most operating systems come with their own basic endpoint-protection utilities installed
(in Windows it is known as Defender), but there are many commercial operators in this
space. CrowdStrike is one such operator, which became famous for all the wrong reasons
when, on 19 July 2024, it sent out a faulty update for its Falcon Sensor product that resulted
in over 8 million Windows computers getting stuck at the infamous Blue Screen of Death
(BSOD), affecting critical systems for airlines, banks, hospitals, supermarkets and many other

organizations around the globe.

B Multifactor authentication (MFA)
Multifactor authentication systems are an easy-to»

implement measure that require more than one method of
)

authentication by users to verify their identity.
The commonly stated goal of introducing multiple factors

y

.

is to require two of the three means by which a user can

prove their identiry:
m

Something they know (e.g. a password).

®m Something they have (e.g. their phone — by way of
|

receiving or generating a code).

m Something they are (e.g. a biometric, such as fingerprint
or facial recognition).
As a consumer, you should enable two-factor

authentication on as many services as possible and use an
app such as Authy.
M One-time passcode

A2 .4 Network security

AINO TH

(;Top tip!
Adding one-time codes to your projects
As a beginner software developer, there are libraries available that make it very easy to incorporate
one-time codes that are compatible with all the major authentication apps. For Python, search
online for the PyOPT library (https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp).

B Secure socket layer (SSL) certificate and transport layer security
(TLS) certificate
SSL and TLS certificates allow consumers to authenticate the developer or organization that
authored a software product. Developers and companies can use these certificates to digitally
sign the project as their work, thereby giving trust and confidence to the consumer. These
digital certificates are discussed in more detail in Section A2.4.4.

B Update software
Keeping your software up to date by regularly applying all the latest security patches is an
important step for mitigating the risk of falling victim to a security vulnerability.

B Virtual private networks (VPN)
As previously discussed, VPNs provide a secure means to exchange data with a remorte office
as if your device was connected directly to the private network. Companies regularly require
their employees to make use of VPN technologies whenever they are working remotely away
from the office.

Bl Testing and training
Regular testing of your security measures, including “white hat” penetration testing and
vulnerability assessments, forms a critical part of ensuring systems remain secure. Testing
helps ensure your systems still work as you expect, and that no new weaknesses have emerged.
As part of the testing, there should also be regular training for staff within an organization.
Many security breaches occur through human error, so training employees in security best
practices on an ongoing basis is also a crucial part of any security regime.

B Wireless security measures
Wireless networks pose a unique vulnerability to any computer network and require special
security measures to identity and mitigate risks. One commonly used measure is to restrict
access to the network to each device’s unique media access control (MAC) address. The MAC

address is a unique 48-bit address assigned to each network card by the manufacturer, so these
can be used to populate an allow-list of devices permitted to connect to the network.

B Secured backups
When was the last time you backed up your files?! For data that matters to you, take
responsibility for its care and protection. Don't just rely on cloud services either, as they are

known to fail occasionally. Purchase a spare portable drive to keep in the back of your sock
drawer, and copy your data to it at least once a month.

A2 Networks

(;Top tip!
Data synchronization tool
For students confident with using console commands, rsync is the best tool for copying files for
backups. Search online for “manpagez: man pages & more man rsync(1)” for the documentation
(www.manpagez.com/man/1/rsync).

If you are less confident with the console, search online for “Free File Sync”, a free, open-source file
synchronization toal (https://freefilesync.org).
Tinally, if your backups resemble a collection of portable drives, you should consider the
security of your backups! An attacker doesn't need to penetrate your network if they can just
pinch a USB drive!

# Encryption key: a
string of characters or
numbers used by an
encryption algorithm
to encode or decode
data. It is the values
that are input into
the mathematical
functions responsible
for scrambling or
descrambling the data.

Symmetric encryption is where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting
the data. This means the key must be shared between both the sender and receiver in a

secure manner.
Symmetric encryption is generally faster and less computationally intensive than its
asymmetric equivalent, so it makes sense to use it for encrypting large files.
When physical distance separates the sender and receiver, it can be difticult to share the
encryption key in such a manner as to be protected against eavesdroppers. There are two
common solutions to this problem:
B Use asymmetric encryption to establish secure communications. Use this asymmetric
method to exchange and agree on a symmetric key, and then switch communications to the
faster, more efficient symmetric approach.
B Use a mathematically secure method to exchange keys, such as Diffie Hellman (covered
later in this section).

Encrypted data

Original text

Asymmetric encryption is when the security key used to encrypt data is different from the key
used to decrypt it. If it can work successfully, there are significant benefits to be gained, as it
means two parties wanting to communicate in encrypted form do not have to meet privately to
exchange an agreed-upon encryption key, as is required for symmetric encryption. Instead, the
encryption key can be published publicly, and any person wishing to send a message can use it

to encrypt the data, so that only the recipient and key-holder can decrypt it to read.
For example: If Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, she encrypts it using Bob's public
key. Only Bob can decrypt this message with his private key.
How does it work? How is it algorithmically possible to use one cipher key to encode the data
and a different key to decode it? The answer is mathematics! The following walkthrough,

inspired by an example by Henry
J. Schmale, is simplified and loosely based on the RSA
(Rivest—Shamir—Adleman) encryption algorithm.

(; Key information
The mathematical walkthrough is provided to demonstrate how such algorithms are possible, as an
exerdse of intellectual interest. Understanding the mathematics is beyond the scope of the syllabus.
You will not be examined on this procedure or asked to do these calculations in the exams.

A2 Networks

Step 1: Generate your public and private key
Start by selecting two prime numbers. These are generally very large: up to 2048 bits is typical.
We will use 61 and 53 for our walkthrough.
p=06l
q=53
Tind n, the product of the two primes, and A(n) (known as “Carmichael’s totient function”).

To follow the maths, all you need to appreciate is that it is the least common multiple of

(p-D(q-D.

n=pq=61x53=3233
and

Aln) = lem[(p- D(g — DI = lem(60,52) = 780
Select an integer, e, that is a prime number, less than A(n), and not a factor of A(n). A common

choice is 2' + 1, being 65537.
e=17
Solve d, where (d x €) mod A(n) = 1. This is known as the “modular multiplicative inverse”.
That is, (17 d) mod (780) = 1. One valid answer in this case is d = 413.
The public key will be the two numbers n = 3233, ¢ = 17, and the private key will be the two
numbers n = 3233, d = 413.

Step 2: Encrypt your secret message
The cipher text, c, for a secret message, m, is given by the following equation:
c(m) = m*mod n

So, if the secret message is A, which is ASCII 65:
c(65) = 65'"mod 3233 = 2790

Step 3: Decrypt your secret message
The message, m, for cipher text ¢ is given by the following equation:

m(c) = c*mod n
So, when given cipher text 2790, this would be decrypted as follows:
m(2790) = 2790*" mod 3233 = 65"
The security of the algorithm rests in the size of the prime numbers and that factorizing a
number into its two constituent primes is still not possible except by brute force of trying
every possible set of values. The original prime number factors are required to be able to
calculate A(n). In this case, it would be trivial to tind the factors of 3233, but finding the factors

of a 4096-bit number would take hundreds or thousands of years.
One area of active computing research that may threaten the security of RSA-encrypted
data is quantum computing. Shor’s algorithm, specifically, is a quantum algorithm
for the factorization of integers that could work very quickly and render modern
cryptography obsolete.

M Role of digital certificates
Digital certificates are used as a way of certifying identity on the internet. For HTTPS traffic,
they are issued by a murually trusted third party known as a “certificate authority (CA)".

When a digital certificate is presented in a network transaction, it helps the recipient verify
that the public key belongs to the sender and not an imposter. Digital certificates form a key

part of the network of trust on the internet. It’s not enough to know that your communication

A2 .4 Network security

with yourbank . com is encrypted, if any ol’ person can pose as the legitimate web server for
yourbank . com. You want to know the web server you are logging in to is the one you want
to share your secrets with.

Obtaining a certificate
The process starts by yourbank . com requesting that a certificate authority (that is mutually
trusted by both parties) issues a certificate that can be used to prove they are, indeed, the
legitimate server for yourbank . com. The bank will generate a public and private key using a
process similar to that previously discussed with the RSA algorithm. The private key is kept
secure on the bank’s server, while the public key is sent to the certificate authority with the
request for certification.
Using the public key provided in the certification request, the CA will verity the identity and
legitimacy of the bank. This process varies, and is dependent on the process applied by the
certificate authority. In the early days of the internet, it required sending photo 1D proof, business
ownership certificates and other legal documents to the CA. Modern practice has simplified this
significantly to encourage broader adoption of HTTPS, so now certificate authorities such as
letsencrypt.org offer the service for free and without complex paperwork.
Once the CA is sartisfied with the verification, it will use its private key to sign the public key

of the bank or other website. This signing process involves creating a hash of the certificate
that is then encrypted using the CA’s private key. This encrypted hash becomes the electronic

signature. It can't be produced without the CA’s private key, but it can be validated through
using the CA’s public key.

M Signing with a digital certificate

Once issued, the digital certificate can be attached to all communications from the bank or
other organization, and used to cryptographically sign the communication. This provides a

mechanism of allowing recipients to algorithmically verify the authenticity of the origin of
the communication.
A2 Networks

Digital certificates can also be selt-generated to create public and private keys that can be used
for secure login to network services, such as via SSH (Secure Shell). In this case, your public
key is uploaded to the remote machine you want to authenticate yourself to later and you
keep the private key secure on your own local machine. The private key is equivalent to your

password. When you want to log in via SSH, the server will generate a challenge to you that
is encrypted with the public key. You, as the sole person in possession of the private key, are

therefore the only person able to decrypt the challenge and thereby prove your identity.
Given the crucial importance of cryptographic keys in the modern interconnected economy,
proper storage of keys is essential. If anyone gains unauthorized access to an organization’s
private keys, they can act as an imposter of that organization in all electronic transactions
for which that key has been set up to be used. The crearion, distriburion, usage, storage and
eventual retirement and deletion of encryption keys is therefore a key task of any effective
1T infrastructure.

Digital certificates are a core part of blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrencies. All
transactions on a blockchain are both signed and hashed. Senders use their private keys to
digitally sign transactions as part of the process of validating themselves as the owner of the
cryptocoin that they are spending. This signature serves to authenticate the identity of the
sender and ensure the non-repudiation of the transaction. The sender cannot later deny having
made the transaction.

Given that asymmetric encryption algorithms require significantly
more processing than symmetric algorithms, it is ideal if lengthy
COmMmUIIcation Sessions can occur using symmetric encryption.
The obvious problem that occurs then is to find a secure method of
exchanging and agreeing on the symmetric key. While asymmetric
encryption could be used to do this, it is slower and more processing
intensive. An alternative approach that is commonly used is known as
the “Diffie Hellman key exchange™.

The analogy used to describe Diffie Hellman is the difficulty of

From an algorithmic perspective, Ditfie Hellman relies on the same
principles of asymmetric encryption with respect to prime numbers
and the mathematical difficulty of determining the prime factors of a
number once run through a modulus operation.

This is a mathematical walkthrough of the Diffie Hellman algorithm:

M Raspberry Pi network structure

Create a small network using Raspberry Pi to simulate real-world network scenarios, including client-server and
peer-to-peer architectures, routing and basic network security implementations.
If you are completing this task as a class, split into small groups, allocating one Raspberry Pi per group. Assign each
Raspberry Pi one of the following roles:
Firewall and router
Proxy server
Web server
DHCP server
Wireless access point server
DNS server (optional)
The following instructions suggest utility programs and configuration files that would be useful for achieving your

objectives but lack sufficient particularity to complete the instruction without further research by your team. The
information provided is mostly to help you know you are on the right track when searching for guides online.
Materials needed:
Several Raspberry Pi computers (at least one per group; ideally three or four per group for diverse roles)

SD cards with Raspberry Pi OS installed
Ethernet cables
Network switch (or a router with multiple Ethernet ports)

Monitors, keyboards and mice for interfacing with the Raspberry Pi computers
B Internet connection (for downloading packages and updates)
Initial set-up for all Raspberry Pi computers:
B Each Raspberry Pi needs the Raspberry Pi OS installed and updated. You can download the latest version from
the official Raspberry Pi website and write it to an SD card. Connect the Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, monitor

and mouse and power up. The default login credentials are username pi and password raspberry. When
configuring the Raspberry Pi computers, enable SsH and vNC to ease remote access later.
B

You may need occasionally to temporarily connect the Raspberry Pi computers directly to an internet

connection, rather than to your custom network, for the purposes of installing updates and other programs.

A2 Networks

For the Raspberry Pi designated as router and firewall:
1 Ensure the Raspberry Pi is obtaining an IP address from the DHCP server. This Pi will need a static IP (so other Pi
computers can find it to request internet traffic), so the DHCP server will need the MAC address of this Pi so as
to assign it the same IP address each time. To view the IP address from the console, use the command ip a.

2

To set a static IP directly (without the DHCP server), edit the file /etc/dhcpcd.conf as follows:
interface etho

static ip

address=192.168.1.1/24

static routers=192.168.1.254

w

static domain

5

name _servers=192.168.1.254

Enable IP forwarding by editing /etc/sysctl.conf.
Set up the WiFi connection to your school WiFi network (or other network providing outbound internet access)
by running sudo raspi-config.
Configure NAT and the firewall with nftables. The main configuration file will be /etc/nftables.conf. A basic
template configuration may resemble:

table inet filter ({
chain input {
type filter hook input priority 0;
# Accept any localhost traffic

iif lo accept
# Accept traffic already established
ct state established,related accept
# Enable HTTP and HTTES
tcp dport { http,

https } accept

# Drop everything else
counter drop

To apply change to rules, run this command: sudo nft -f /etc/nftables.conf.
Reboot the Pi for settings to take effect, and then test.

For the Raspberry Pi designated as wireless access point:
1 Install hostapd as your access point host software.
2 The main configuration file will be /etc/hostapd/hostapd.cont. Suggested settings include:
interface=wlan0

Configure hostapd to use that configuration file by editing /etc/default/hostapd.

4

Prevent the wireless network card from being managed by the default network manager by changing /etc/
dheped.conf and specifying denyinterfaces wlano.

For the Raspberry Pi designated as DHCP server:
1

Install isc-dhcp-server as a DHCP server.

2

The main configuration files will be /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf and /etc/default/isc-dhep-server.

3

Anexample template for /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf is:

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range

192.168.1.10 192.168.1.100;

option routers 192.168.1.1;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

4

Ensure the DHCP server is configured to start on boot.

5

Check the logs for errors by using cat /var/log/syslog | grep dhcp.

For the Raspberry Pi designated as web server:
1

Ensure the Raspberry Pi is obtaining an IP address from the DHCP server. This Pi will need a static IP (so other Pi

oOwn
s WwN

computers can find it to request a webpage), so the DHCP server will need the MAC address of this Pi so as to
assign it the same IP address each time. To view the IP address from the console, use the command ip a.
Install nginx as the web server software, and set it to start automatically on boot.
Create a web page at /var/www/html.

The main configuration files for nginx can be found in /etc/nginx.
If nginx fails to start, you can check for configuration errors by using sudo nginx -t.
An example HTML file for /va/www/html/index.html might resemble:
<!DOCTYPE html=>

<html lang="en">
<head>

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<titlesWelcome to Pi Web Serverc</titles

</head>
<body>

<hl>Hello,

Raspberry Pi Network!sz/hl=>

<p>This is a simple web page served from the Raspberry Pi web server.</p>
</body>
</html>

For the Raspberry Pi designated as proxy server:
1 Ensure the Raspberry Pi is obtaining an IP address from the DHCP server. This Pi will need a static IP (so other Pi
computers can find it to request a webpage), so the DHCP server will need the MAC address of this Pi so as to
assign it the same IP address each time. To view the IP address from the console, use the command ip a.

2
3

Install squid proxy server software, and set it to start automatically on boot.
The main configuration file is at /etc/squid/squid.conf.

A2 Networks

4

In addition to acting as a web cache, because all traffic passes through a proxy it can also be used as a content
filter, for example you could block requests for given URLs. This is similar, though functionally different, from
the firewall approach. Investigate how to use squid to block certain websites.

For the Raspberry Pi designated as DNS server:
1 Ensure the Raspberry Pi is obtaining an IP address from the DHCP server. This Pi will need a static IP (so other Pi
computers can find it to request a webpage), so the DHCP server will need the MAC address of this Pi so as to
assign it the same IP address each time. To view the IP address from the console, use the command ip a.

2

When the configuration for the DNS server is complete, the DHCP server will need updating so clients know to
look to this computer for DNS resolution queries.

3

Install bind9 as your DNS server software, and ensure that it is set to start on boot.

4
5

The main configuration files will be in the folder /etc/bind.
To check the configuration for errors, go to sudo named-checkconf and sudo named-checkzone myhome.

6

An example ZONE file /etc/bind/db.myhome.local to create your own DNS domain (that would work on your
internal network) might resemble:

similar data.
# Entity: a living or

and manipulation of data. There are different types of databases, but your focus will be on

organized as a set of tables made of columns and rows.

Tables
The table is used to describe entities. An entity refers to a living or non-living thing that can

have data stored about it that can be described, such as a person, a chair or an aeroplane.
Each row, also called a tuple, will include a record or an instance of an entity, for example a

specific person, a specific chair or a specific aeroplane. Each column, also called a “field” or an

Update management keeps an operating system secure and performant in an
evolving threat landscape.
Patch management is the process of deploying patches to software systems
to ensure they are up-to-date and secure. Patches are a set of code changes
designed to address problems or update an existing computer program or
its supporting data. Patches fall into different categories, including bug fixes,
security fixes, feature enhancements, and compatibility updates. Patches
often include mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of updates
before installation.
Rollback features allow a return to the last known-good state of the system.
These features enable the system to revert to a previous state if an update
or change causes issues, preserving system integrity. In Windows OS, this is
known as “System Restore”. On macOS, the “Time Machine” feature serves a
similar purpose.
Data integrity checks can use mechanisms such as checksums, hashes, or errorcorrecting codes to detect and potentially correct data corruption caused by
transmission errors or storage issues.
Checksums are digits representing the sum of the correct digits in a piece of
stored ortransmitted digital data, against which later comparisons can be made
to detect errors in the data.
A hash is a fixed-size string or number generated from a data set using a hashing
function that converts varied length inputs into a compressed numerical value,
primarily used for data integrity checks and quick data retrieval.
Checksums and hashes verify the integrity of system files and data by comparing
them against known good checksums or hashes, detecting corruption or
unauthorized changes.
File system consistency checks help ensure the integrity and consistency offile
systems, which can become corrupted due to improper shutdowns, hardware
failures, or uncaught exceptions. Tools like fsck (file system check) are employed,
typically during system boot or designated maintenance windows to verify the
coherence and validity of the file system.
Monitoring and logging are both tools to understand current system
performance and issues (monitoring) and past system performance and
issues (logging).

Hashing and hash functions are
covered in topic B4 Abstract data

Logging collects detailed activity of system operations, security events, and errors,
providing a way to audit system behaviour, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot
issues. Almost every action instantiated by a user or process is logged.

Memory management
Memory management involves allocating and deallocating memory to processes
which need it, and ensuring that each process has separate and protected
memory address space. Memory management also implements virtual memory,
which allows the processes to use more memory than the physical memory
available, by swapping some pages of memory to the disk when needed.
Memory pages are fixed-size, contiguous blocks of virtual memory that form the
basic unit of allocation and transfer between primary storage (RAM) and secondary
storage (disk) in a virtual memory system. The operating system, in conjunction

Al.3 Operating systems and control systems

with the memory management unit (MMU), maintains page tables to track the
mapping of these pages between virtual and physical address spaces. Ifyou
discuss memory without using virtual memory, you use the term “page frames”.
Virtual memory separates the linear memory addresses used by processes from
the underlying physical memory layout. The OS, with hardware support from the
MMU, maps virtual addresses to physical addresses dynamically. This allows for
processes to have large, contiguous address spaces independent of physical
RAM limitations, with the OS transparently paging data between RAM and disk
as needed.

File systems
A file system is a method used by an operating system to control how data is
stored and retrieved. It provides a block-level organization for files on physical
storage devices such as hard disks, SSDs, or USB flash drives. The file system
defines the rules for naming files, the structure of directories (or folders), and how

files and directories are displayed to the user. It also manages the allocation of
disk space to files and directories and keeps track of which areas of the disk are
available for use. Examples of file systems include NTFS (used by Windows), ext4
(used by Linux), and APFS (used by macQOS).

Device management
Device management enables interaction between the operating system and hardware
via device drivers. These drivers convert commands from the operating system into
specific signals (instructions) tailored for each hardware component, enabling data
transfer (communication) across a variety of devices. Conversely, hardware devices

can initiate communication with the operating system by sending signals or interrupts,
which the operating system processes and responds to accordingly.
Device management is responsible for handling interrupts and errors emanating
from hardware devices, offering a uniform interface for applications to access
hardware resources. For example, user actions such as keyboard strokes or
mouse movements generate interrupts, alerting the operating system to new

user input. Similarly, a network interface card receiving a data packet triggers an
interrupt, prompting the operating system to handle the incoming data.

Scheduling
Scheduling is primarily concerned with determining the order and timing of
process execufion.

Imagine a constantly changing pool of 500 different processes, all needing
processor time. How should these processes be executed? First-come, first-served?
Should the execution time depend on the importance of the process? The size
of the process? Deciding how to allocate CPU time (instruction cycles) falls to
scheduling. Scheduling considers priority, fairness, efficiency, and system load.
There is more about scheduling in the next section.

Security
Operating systems provide firewalls, encryption, access control, user
authentication, security patches, sandboxing, logging, and data integrity.

Al Computer fundamentals

Accounting
Accounting is the tracking and recording of resource usage, such as CPU
time, memory usage, disk space, and network bandwidth. In the early days of
computing, accounting was used to charge users or departments using multiuser mainframes based on how much ofa resource they used. Interestingly,
accounting of resources has returned with cloud-based computing, where
organizations pay for what they use.
The operating system gathers data on how long each process runs, the amount
of memory it utilizes, its disk input/output operations, and other resource
consumption metrics. Based on historical usage patterns, the OS can make more
informed scheduling decisions to optimize resource distribution and ensure fair
allocation.
Accounting is implemented in system logs. The operating system maintains
detailed logs of activity. Each entry in a log includes timestamps, process IDs,
user |Ds, specific resources requested (CPU time, memory allocation, network
bandwidth), and the duration for which these resources were granted. In some

systems, the logs might also record details on denied resource requests, failed
process executions, or errors encountered during resource allocation.
Windows users can view logs by looking for the “Event Viewer” application,
macOS users can open the “Console” application, and Linux users can look

through the /var/log directory.
Reading log files on your computer is an effective, non-destructive method to
help you understand the different aspects of the system your operating system
manages.

Graphical user interface
When most users think of an operating system, they think of the graphical user
interface or GUI (pronounced “gooey”). Windows OS looks different from
macOS, which looks different from some Linux OS GUIs. As a computer scientist,

you know an OS serves as an intermediary between the user, application and the
hardware ofa computer system. The GUI is just one part (albeit an important part)
for the users of the OS.
A Figure 56 A confusing GUI—it is difficult
to understand because it has been poorly
designed

A GUI facilitates interacting with a computer system using visual elements, such
as icons, menus, windows and buttons. The graphical user interface makes
the computer system easier to use, and allows the user to perform tasks with a
mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, or other input devices.

GUIs are constantly being updated and improved to make them easier and more
intuitive to use. A well-established field within computing is human—computer
interaction, which guides thinking about computing interfaces.

Virtualization
Virtualization involves creating virtual instances of physical hardware.
Virtualization enables a single physical machine to host multiple virtual machines
(VMs), with each VM operating as though it has its own dedicated hardware.
Think of virtualization like dividing up a big house into separate apartments. Each
apartment gets its own rooms and resources, even though they all share the same
physical building.

Al.3 Operating systems and control systems

The technical key to virtualization is the hypervisor, a
specialized software layer which enables the interaction
between virtual machines and the physical hardware. The
hypervisor divides the underlying computer into smaller,
virtualized chunks. Each VM is given a portion of these
virtualized resources. The hypervisor ensures that VMs stay
within their boundaries and don't interfere with each other.
The hypervisor tricks each virtual machine into thinking it
actually has direct access to the physical hardware, even
though it is a virtualized environment.

Virtual machine

There are two main benefits of virtualization. The first benefit
is efficient use of computing resources—multiple VMs can
A Figure 57 Ahypervisor model
share a single system’s CPU, memory and storage, increasing
hardware utilization and reducing infrastructure costs. The second is isolation,
where VMs are isolated from each other. A failure or security compromise in one
VM does not affect others.

Networking
Operating systems facilitate networking via a software stack designed to manage
network communications. Networks operate by segmenting data into packets
and transmitting those packets across networks. When an operating system
receives packets, it puts them back together so applications can use them.

You will learn about networking in
more detail in topic A2 Networks.

The network stack, or network protocol stack, comprises networking protocols
and layers that collectively enable network communication. This stack is commonly
associated with the TCP/IP model, detailed in A2. Key points to remember include:
*

operating systems implement the network stack

*

the process of ensuring reliable, robust, and secure digital communication is
complex, requiring the cooperation of multiple software layers.

A Figure 58 The TCP/IP model

Operating systems support and manage network hardware such as network
interface cards (NICs) via device drivers. These drivers abstract the hardware

details, providing a standardized interface to the network stack for data
transmission and reception, regardless of the hardware used.
Network configurations on operating systems include setting IP addresses for
network interfaces, either statically by the user or dynamically through dynamic
host configuration protocol (DHCP). This step is vital for device identification on a
network
and their subsequent communication.
To safeguard network communications, operating systems deploy security
measures such as firewalls to manage packet flow, encryption (for example,
SSL/TLS for web traffic) for secure data transmission, and authentication
protocols for identity verification.
Operating systems also come equipped with a variety of network utilities and
command-line tools for troubleshooting, configuration and monitoring purposes.
These tools include:
*

ping: to test host reachability

*

ifconfig/ipconfig: for network interface configuration

*

netstat: toview network connections

*

traceroute/tracert: totrace packet routes to a destination.

Table 15 Approaches to scheduling
Scheduling approach

First-come, first-served (FCFS)

Definition
Processes are assigned CPU time in the order they arrive in the ready queue, with no
pre-emption. The primary metric is arrival time. The CPU serves one process completely
before moving on to the next in the queue. It is non-pre-emptive, meaning once a
process starts execution, it runs to completion.

Round robin

A pre-emptive scheduling algorithm designed to ensure all processes receive an
equal share of the CPU time in a cyclic order. It is characterized by a fixed time slice or
quantum, after which the currently running process is swapped out of the CPU ifit has
not finished execution, allowing the next process in the queue to execute. If a process
does not finish during its quantum, it is placed at the back of the ready queue. This
continues in a circular queue fashion, hence the name.
Divides the ready queue into several separate queues, each with its own scheduling
algorithm and priority level. Processes are permanently assigned to a queue based

Multilevel queue scheduling

on their priority or other characteristics, such as process type (system versus user,

foreground versus background). Scheduling between the queues can be done based
on fixed priority (where each queue has a fixed priority over others) or using round robin

(cycling through queues in order).

Priority scheduling

Assigns a priority to each process, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the
highest priority. In pre-emptive priority scheduling, ifa new process arrives with a higher
priority than the currently running process, the current process is suspended, and the
CPU is allocated to the new process. In non-pre-emptive priority scheduling, the current
process continues until completion before the system checks the queue for the next
highest-priority process.

A1.3.4 Evaluate the use of polling and
interrupt handling
Interrupt handling and polling are two methods of managing and handling
communication between the CPU and devices or programs.
Aninterrupt is a signal to the processor from a device attached to the computer
or from a program within the computer that causes the processor
to stop and
figure out what to do next. In essence, it interrupts the current processor activity
to indicate that it needs immediate attention. When an interrupt is received, the
processor saves its state (or context) and starts executing the interrupt service
routine (ISR) to deal with the interrupt. After the ISR is finished, the processor

A Figure
60 Aninterrupt

resumes its previous state and continues its prior task. This mechanism allows the
CPU to respond promptly
to important events, improving the system’s efficiency
and responsiveness.

Discuss with a partner or group
the implications of interrupts and
polling for managing real-world
scenarios such as user inputs and

Polling is a technique in which the processor repeatedly checks the status of a
device at regular intervals to see if it needs attention. This is done by executing a
sequence of instructions that inquire if the device has data to transfer or ifit can
accept new data. Polling is essentially a loop that continuously checks the status
of all devices one by one. This method is straightforward but can be inefficient
because the processor is busy checking devices instead of performing other
tasks. Polling is used when device activity is infrequent or when immediate action

Keyboard and mouse inputs
Interrupts are typically used for keyboard and mouse inputs to ensure immediate
responsiveness. When a key is pressed or the mouse is moved, an interrupt
signals the CPU to process the input right away, providing a seamless experience
to the user. Polling these devices would introduce noticeable lag and decrease
user satisfaction.

Polling might introduce variable
latency, depending on when an
event happens in relation to the
polling cycle.

Al Computer fundamentals

Network communications
Network communications use interrupts where incoming packets can arrive
unpredictably. An interrupt-driven approach allows the network interface card
(NIC) to alert the CPU of incoming data, ensuring timely processing and reducing
latency. Polling could lead to delays in data processing and increased latency,
which is undesirable, especially in high-speed networking environments.

Disk input/output operations
Interrupts are preferred for disk |/O operations to notify the CPU when a read
or write operation is complete. This allows the system to efficiently manage data
transfers without constantly checking the status of disk operations, freeing the
CPU to perform other tasks. Polling for disk I/O completion could negatively
impact system performance due to the relatively slow nature of disk operations
compared to CPU speeds.

Embedded systems
Embedded systems, such as sensors in loT devices, often rely on interrupts for
efficient power management. These devices usually operate on battery power
and need to conserve energy by staying in a low-power state untilan event (e.g., a
sensor detecting a change) triggers an interrupt. Polling would require the device
to be awake more frequently, consuming more power and reducing battery life.

Real-time systems
Real-time systems, such as those used in medical devices, automotive controllers,

or industrial machinery, require interrupts to meet strict timing constraints. In these
systems, controlled latency is critical. The system must respond to inputs or changes
in conditions within a guaranteed time frame to ensure safety and effectiveness.
Polling could not provide the timely response needed for these critical applications.

Moving your mouse
When you move your mouse, a series of steps occur from the physical movement
to the cursor moving on the screen.
Physical movement: You move the mouse. The motion is detected by the
mouse’s Sensors.
Signal generation: The mouse’s sensor converts the physical movement into
electronic signals, encoding the direction and distance of the movement.

A Figure 61 When you move your mouse,
a series of steps occur

Data packet formation: The electronic signals are formatted into data packets
by the mouse’s internal processor. These packets include information about the
movement and any button clicks.
Transmission to the computer: The data packets are sent to the computer.
This happens over a wired connection (USB, PS/2) or wirelessly (Bluetooth, RF).
Interrupt signal: Upon receiving the data, the computer’s USB or Bluetooth
interface generates an interrupt signal to the CPU, indicating that there isinput
data to be processed.
Interrupt service routine (ISR) activation: The CPU pauses its current tasks,
saving its state, and executes the ISR designated for handling mouse inputs.
This routine is part of the operating system’s device drivers.

Al.3 Operating systems and control systems

Data interpretation: Within the ISR, the data packets from the mouse are read
and interpreted to understand the movement and button states.
Cursor movement calculation: The operating system calculates the new position
of the cursor based on the interpreted mouse movement data and the current cursor
position. Factors like pointer speed settings are taken into account.
Screen update: The operating system sends instructions to the graphics
processing unit (GPU) to update the cursor’s position on the screen.
Cursor redraw: The GPU redraws the cursor at its new location on the display,
making the movement visible to you.
Resume previous CPU tasks: Once the ISR has completed its execution, the
CPU restores its previous state and resumes its interrupted tasks.
This process happens so rapidly that the cursor movement on the screen
appears seamless and instantaneous to the user. The frequency with which the
mouse reports its position to the computer is measured in Hz (times per second).
A common reporting rate for modern mice can range from 125 Hz (125 times a
second, an 8 ms delay) to over 1000 Hz (1000 times a second, a 1 ms delay).
Gaming mice significantly reduce latency. As they are engineered with higher polling
rates, these mice communicate their position to the computer more frequently,
reducing the delay between a click and its corresponding action on-screen.

multithreading, where multiple threads within a process can share resources and
execute concurrently. These are two related, but different concepts.
Resource allocation
Resource allocation is the process of efficiently distributing computer resources
among various tasks, processes, or users. |t is the operating system which manages
multitasking and efficient resource allocation. It is a complex job, highly dynamic,
and critical to producing efficient performance in a computer system.

Multitasking mechanisms
The OS tracks each running program as a process with its own set of resources
(memory, CPU time, open files). It maintains process tables with information
such as process state (running, waiting, blocked), priority, and resource usage.
This is called process management.

A Figure 63 Multitasking

Al Computer fundamentals

Based on different ever-changing factors, the OS decides what type of
scheduling to use to execute a process queue.
When the OS switches between processes, it saves the state of the current

process (register values, memory pointers) in its process table and loads the state
of the next process to be scheduled. This process happens extremely fast, often
in microseconds, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution. This mechanism
of switching is called context switching.
Resource allocation mechanisms
The OS allocates and manages various system resources to ensure efficient
functioning of multiple processes.
Memory management: Paging is when the OS divides physical memory into
fixed-size blocks called pages. It maps these pages to the virtual address space of
each process. This gives the illusion ofa larger, continuous memory space and makes
memory usage more efficient.
Segmentation is when the OS may organize memory into variable-sized
segments for each process (for example, code segment, data segment).
Segmentation provides logical structure and enhanced memory protection.
Refer to section Al.3.2 for more
information on virtual memory.

Virtual memory is a combination of paging and segmentation that allows the
OS to extend available memory using secondary storage (HDD or SSD), giving
processes access to seemingly more RAM than is physically installed.
Device management: The OS uses device drivers to communicate with specific
hardware components. This ensures proper access, prevents conflicts among
processes, and provides an organized way to use peripherals like printers and
network cards.
File systems: The OS provides an abstraction layer on top of the raw storage
hardware (like hard disk drives or solid-state drives). This layer is the file system
and is responsible for defining how data is stored, named, and organized into
files and directories (folders). Common file systems include NTFS (Windows),
APFS (macOS), and ext4 (Linux). File systems work with the underlying storage
devices at the block level. A block is a fixed-size chunk of storage, typically
several kilobytes in size. When you read or write a file, the file system translates
those operations into interactions with specific blocks on the disk.
Resource monitoring and limits: The OS tracks how processes use resources
such as the CPU, memory, and disk input/output (I/O). It can set quotas or limits

all processes or threads in a system.

blocking) When a process is

to prevent a single process from using disproportionate resources, ensuring

overall system stability.

Task scheduling
Task scheduling ensures that all running tasks are allocated time on the CPU
efficiently, balancing system responsiveness, resource utilization, and fairness
amongst tasks.
Fairness is deciding which process gets the CPU at any given time and
involves balancing fairness and efficiency. High-priority tasks should not
starve, while low-priority ones should not monopolize resources.

Al.3 Operating systems and control systems

Different scheduling algorithms, such as priority scheduling or round robin
scheduling, each have strengths and weaknesses, making choosing the optimal
strategy a complex decision based on current system load.
Pre-emption is suspending a running process fora higher-priority one, which
can lead to context switching overhead, impacting performance.
In extreme cases, low-priority tasks might never get CPU time if higher-priority
ones constantly demand it. Starvation prevention strategies are essential to
guarantee basic responsiveness even for less critical tasks.
Resource contention
Resource contention occurs when multiple programs or processes attempt to
access the same resource simultaneously, but the resource cannot accommodate
multiple concurrent accesses.
Processes can entera deadlock state where each process needs a resource held by
another, leading to a system standstill. Deadlock detection and avoidance algorithms
are necessary to prevent these scenarios and keep the system operational.
Similarly, livelock occurs when processes can get stuck in a cycle of constantly
requesting and releasing resources, never making progress.
Thrashing occurs when pages are continuously swapping in and out of physical
memory due to insufficient memory. Memory management techniques like demand
paging and virtual memory allocation need to be optimized to prevent thrashing.
Deadlock
Deadlock is a specific condition in concurrent computing where two or more
processes are each waiting for another to release a resource, or more than
two processes are waiting for resources in a circular chain, so that none of the
processes can proceed.
Operating systems must be effective in identifying deadlock situations. The OS
can employ algorithms to monitor resource dependencies and detect potential
deadlocks before they occur.

@Thinking skills
Consider the challenges in
balancing processes for optimal
computer system performance

discussed in this section. Suggest
how these challenges can best be
addressed.

Once a deadlock is detected, the OS must take action to break the cycle (release

the deadlock) and free up resources. This might involve terminating processes,
pre-empting tasks, or reallocating resources.
Proactive measures such as deadlock avoidance algorithms can prevent
deadlocks from happening in the first place. This is known as prevention. These
algorithms analyse resource requests and deny certain requests to avoid creating
cyclic dependencies.

A1.3.6 Describe the use of the control
system components
A control system is a device or set of devices which manage, command, direct
or regulate the behaviour of other devices or systems using control loops. Some
examples of controls include automatic elevator control, automatic washing
machine, and traffic signal control system.

Whenever a control system has
the potential to cause harm,
exceptional care must be taken to
ensure the design and construction
of the system is safe.
How can understanding the
components and mechanisms of
control systems—such as input,
process, output and feedback—
contribute to avoiding harm in
real-world scenarios such as traffic
signal control?

A1.3.7 Explain the use of control systems in
a range of real-world applications
Complex control systems with sensors, algorithms
and actuators
Autonomous vehicles
Autonomous vehicles are complex control systems that rely on a sophisticated
interplay of sensors, algorithms and actuators. While they follow the overarching
IPO model, their underlying technologies are highly specialized. Sensors like
LIDAR (for 3D mapping and object detection), radar (for object detection in bad
weather), cameras (for visual recognition tasks), ultrasonic sensors (for closerange proximity), and IMUs (for the vehicle’s own motion tracking) provide
essential data about the environment.
Control algorithms implement path-planning algorithms, calculate routes, and
utilize localization techniques to precisely determine the vehicle’s position. In
addition, control algorithms enable obstacle avoidance algorithms to predict
collisions, and Al-powered decision-making systems to interpret traffic situations.
Finally, actuators such as electromechanical steering systems, electronic throttle
control, and integrated anti-lock braking systems (ABS) physically carry out the
navigational decisions made by the control system.
Home thermostats
Home thermostats and large-scale building management systems (BMS) both
regulate temperature using the same core components: sensors, controllers and
actuators. Home thermostats typically rely on simple sensors such as bimetallic
strips or digital thermistors. These sensors provide temperature readings to the
controller, which may use basic on/off logic or more sophisticated PID algorithms
for smoother control. The controller then activates actuators such as relays or
switches to turn the furnace or air conditioner on or off.

A Figure 68 Fully autonomous vehicles

TOK
Sophisticated control systems

complex processing systems
to make driving decisions and
maintain safety standards.
How do control systems enhance
the functionality and safety of
autonomous vehicles? What
assumptions about safety, humans
and computers are embedded into
the design of these systems?

Building management systems take this principle to a larger scale. A network of
temperature sensors provides detailed data to a centralized controller, which
incorporates factors such as occupancy, weather, and energy costs. Advanced BMS
systems might use predictive modelling and machine leaming to optimize both comfort
and energy efficiency. These systems control complex HVAC (heating, ventilation and
air conditioning) equipment, including chillers, boilers and fans. The systems may even
integrate with lighting and blinds for comprehensive energy management.

A Figure 69 Home thermostats regulate

temperature using sensors, controllers and

Automatic elevator control systems aim to optimize elevator operations, ensuring
passengers experience minimal wait and travel times. These systems use sensors
to monitor the current position of elevators and where passengers have requested
stops (floor positions). A central controller then processes this information,
employing algorithms to determine the most efficient way to assign elevators to call
requests. This intelligent direction of traffic flow reduces waiting and journey times.
Actuators control the motors that physically move the elevator cars between floors.

Automatic washing machines
Automatic washing machines streamline the laundry process by integrating sensors,
intelligent controllers and actuators.

A Figure 70 Elevator control systems
reduce waiting and journey times

Al Computer fundamentals

They often utilize weight sensors or water level sensors to assess the size of the
laundry load. A central controller, perhaps using fuzzy logic algorithms, then
determines optimal cycle settings. These settings might include wash duration, water
temperature, agitation levels and spin speeds, matching the washing process to
the needs of the specificload. Actuators control critical elements: water inlet valves
regulate water flow, drain valves allow for water removal, and powerful motors
drive the washing drum during agitation and spin cycles. Some advanced washing
machines might even include sensors to monitor the turbidity (dirtiness) of the water,

adjusting the cycle accordingly for greater efficiency.

Traffic signal control systems

A Figure 71 Traffic control systems might
use real-time traffic data to optimize timing

patterns

Traffic signal control systems manage traffic flow, aiming to reduce congestion
and improve safety at intersections. These systems employ a range of sensors
to gather real-time traffic data. Inductive loop detectors, embedded in the road
surface, sense the presence of vehicles through electromagnetic fields. Cameras,
coupled with computer vision, identify and count vehicles, sometimes even
differentiating between vehicle types. Pressure-sensitive pads detect pedestrians
at crosswalks, allowing for safe crossing. A controller processes this sensor
data. Older systems use pre-timed schedules, whereas actuated controllers
offer dynamic signal timing based on traffic conditions. Advanced adaptive
traffic control systems (ATCS) may even use Al algorithms to optimize traffic flow
across entire networks of intersections. Ultimately, the system directs actuators—
the traffic lights themselves (red, amber, green) and pedestrian signals—to
implement the optimized timing patterns.

Irrigation control systems
Irrigation control systems bring precision and automation to agricultural watering,
promoting healthy crop growth while minimizing water waste. Soil moisture
sensors include tensiometers, measuring soil water tension, or capacitancebased sensors that detect moisture levels directly. A central controller, often

incorporating programmed crop-specific watering schedules, processes the
sensor data. Advanced systems might integrate weather data (forecasts, rain
sensors) to further optimize irrigation cycles. The controller then directs actuators,
typically solenoid-operated valves, to open and close irrigation lines, ensuring
water reaches the fields precisely when needed. Some sophisticated systems
may even employ variable-rate irrigation, tailoring water delivery to specific zones
within a field, based on localized sensor readings.

Home security systems
Home security systems protect against intrusion, fire, and other hazards through a
network of sensors, a central controller, and various actuators. Sensors are the eyes

and ears of the system, including motion detectors (often using passive infrared
technology), door and window contacts that sense when they are opened, and glass
break detectors (acoustic sensors with a shock sensor—the shock sensor detects

vibrations directly on the glass). Additionally, smoke and heat detectors and carbon
monoxide sensors monitor for environmental hazards. A control panel processes
the data from these sensors, using its programmed logic to determine if a real threat
exists. If so, it activates actuators such as loud sirens to deter intruders, smart locks for
added security, and sends notifications to homeowners ora monitoring service.
Automatic doors
Automatic doors offer convenience and conserve energy by automating entry and
exit points. They rely on motion or optical sensors to detect people approaching.

Al.3 Operating systems and control systems

Moation sensors often use microwave or infrared (IR) technology. Microwave sensors
send out pulses and analyse the reflected signal for changes, while IR sensors
detect differences in heat patterns. Optical sensors, like those used in sliding doors,
create a grid of infrared beams—breaking these beams indicates the presence
of a person. A controller processes this sensor data and may incorporate logic to
prevent false triggers (for example, only opening when someone approaches from
a certain direction). The controller then signals actuators to open and close the door
smoothly—these are typically electric motors coupled with gear systems or hydraulic
mechanisms. Some systems include safety sensors, such as light curtains, as an
additional precaution to prevent the door from closing on an individual or object.

A computer file that contains machine code instructions in a format that a particular operating
system (such as Windows, macOS or Linux) can directly load into memory and execute.

Bytecode

Aform of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter.

The mechanics and use cases of each translation

approach
Interpreted programming languages
An interpreted language is translated into machine language line by line, as the
program is run. It reads, interprets, and executes each line of code in sequence.
Interpreters stop at the first error they encounter and report it, making them
useful for debugging. The program will not continue until the error is resclved.
Since interpretation happens in real-time, interpreted programs generally run
slower compared to compiled programs because each line of code is translated
during execution. They often use less memory as they do not generate an output
file containing machine code. Instead, they read the source code directly.
Interpreted languages are typically more platform-independent—the interpreter
acts as a layer between the source code and the machine code of the underlying
operating system.
Interpreted programming languages include Python, PHP, Ruby and JavaScript.

Python is widely used in the sciences, where researchers can quickly
develop and iterate programs to analyse and visualize data, transform
complex data sets, and implement sophisticated machine learning.
As an interpreted language, Python enables rapid development. The
time to write, execute and test code is very short. In comparison to
interpreted languages, compiled languages take longer
to execute
(but tend to run faster).
Katie Bouman led a team that created a new algorithm to produce
the firstimage ofa black hole. Python played a significant role in this
scientific achievement. Researchers used various Python lvibraries
to process the massive amounts of data collected by the telescope
network and to perform complex computational tasks necessary to
produce the image.

Syntax analysis

language’s grammar rules.

The syntax parser verifies that print ( "Hello

which enclose arguments.

The interpreter checks for semantic errors such
as type mismatches and undeclared variables

Code generation

The parsed code is translated into an
intermediate representation (bytecode) specific

byte code is designed to be executed by a
virtual machine (Python Virtual Machine).

The use case for interpreted languages
Interpreted languages have a very fast feedback loop during development.
Interpreted languages do not have a compile-run cycle (write code, compile
code, execute code, go back to writing code). You make code changes and
very quickly see results. This leads
to faster iteration during development than
compiled languages. The immediacy of code execution facilitates a more
dynamic and exploratory coding process.
Interpreted languages often employ dynamic typing, which allows variables to
be assigned to any type of object at runtime, reducing the amount of boilerplate
code required for type definitions and enabling faster development.
Scripts written in interpreted languages are generally platform-independent,
running on any operating system that has the interpreter installed. This eliminates
the need for platform-specific code, making it easier to deploy automation
solutions across diverse environments.
Interpreted languages such as Python provide comprehensive standard
libraries which have a wide range of functionalities, from file /O to network

rapid development.

Al.4 Translation

Compiled programming languages
A compiled language is translated from source code to machine language
in its entirety before the program is executed, through a process known as
compilation. The compiler translates the entire code into a binary executable,
which the computer’s processor can then run directly. Compiled programs
are checked for errors during the compilation process. If errors are found, the
compiler will report them, and the executable is not generated until these errors
are resolved. This upfront error checking can make debugging less interactive
compared to interpreted languages but often results in faster execution times
since the program is directly executed in machine language without the need for
real-time translation. Compiled languages tend to use more memory during the
compilation process but can be more efficient in execution since they generate a
directly executable file. This process can make compiled programs less platformindependent, as the executable file is specific to the operating system and
hardware for which it was compiled, requiring different compilations for different
platforms.

Compiled languages include C, C++, Rust, and Go. Examples of compilers are
GCC, CLANG, LLVM, and Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC).

The difference in error detection, translation time,

portability, and applicability for different translation
processes, including just-in-time compilation and
bytecode interpreters
Just-in-time (JIT) compilation
JIT compilation is a hybrid translation process which compiles source code or
bytecode into machine code just before execution, rather than compiling the
source code into machine code in advance or interpreting it directly at runtime.
JIT compilers work by compiling the program’s bytecode (an intermediate
representation of the code) into machine code dynamically at runtime,
as needed. This approach combines the development speed benefits of
interpretation with the execution speed benefits of compilation. Code sections
that are executed frequently can be compiled once and cached for subsequent
executions, greatly improving performance over pure interpretation.

JIT compiled languages include Java, C# (.NET Framework), JavaScript (in certain
environments), and Python (PyPy implementation).

Bytecode interpreters
Bytecode interpreters execute programs written in an intermediate bytecode
language rather than directly executing source code or machine code. Bytecode
is alower-level, platform-independent representation of the source code.
Bytecode is generated by compiling the high-level source code. The bytecode
interpreter then executes this bytecode. This two-step process allows for
portability since the same bytecode can run on any platform with a compatible
interpreter. Bytecode interpreters balance execution speed and development
efficiency, providing faster execution than direct interpretation of source code
while maintaining some level of platform independence.
Bytecode interpreted languages include Python (CPython Implementation), Ruby
(YARV) and Erlang (BEAM VM).

This subtopic deals with the principles and concepts essential for understanding
digital networks. Digital networks are a central part of life and work. Some
organizations could not function without digital networks.

A2.1.1 Describe the purpose and
characteristics of networks
There are many different types of networks, each with a specific use case.
Networks may share characteristics but have very different purposes.

Local area network (LAN)
A local area network (LAN) connects network devices over a short distance.

There is no rigid definition of “short distance”, but LANs are designed to operate
over distances not exceeding approximately one kilometre. Longer distances
introduce latency. LANs are characterized by high data transfer rates and relatively
low latency. LANs can be wired or wireless, but are usually a mix of the two. The
primary goal ofa LAN is to facilitate the sharing of resources such as files, printers,
and software applications among multiple users in a local area.
Examples of LANs include a school or college campus, an office building, a
hospital, a hotel ora restaurant.

A Figure1Local area network (LAN)

101

A2 Networks

Wide area network (WAN)
A wide area network (WAN) connects network devices across large
geographic areas that can span cities, countries, and even continents. WANs
are characterized by their ability to maintain data communication over long
distances. They usually have lower data transfer rates and higher latency
compared to LANSs.
The primary purpose ofa WAN is to enable businesses, governments and other
entities to operate on a wide scale. WANSs facilitate the connection of smaller,
geographically dispersed networks such as LANs and MANs (metropolitan area
networks) into a cohesive system, allowing for centralized data processing,
collaborative work, and access to shared resources regardless of location.
Examples of WAN usage include multinational corporations connecting their
office networks around the world to share corporate resources and communicate
efficiently, and public services providing online access to centralized databases
for citizens in different regions.
WANSs can be established over leased lines or satellite links, or through public
internet connections using virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure security
and privacy. A leased line is a dedicated, fixed-bandwidth communication link
between two locations, provided and maintained by a telecommunications
company. Unlike typical broadband connections, which are shared among
multiple users, a leased line offers exclusive use of the connection for the
customer, ensuring consistent speed, low latency, and reliable performance.
The infrastructure of WANs might involve multiple transmission technologies
and media, ranging from fibre-optic cables to wireless transmissions, to
accommodate the vast distances and varied terrains they cover.

Personal area network (PAN)
A personal area network (PAN) is designed for personal use and usually spans
no more than 10 metres (about 30 feet). This range is optimal for devices
centred around a single person’s workspace or within their immediate physical
environment. PANs are characterized by their convenience for inter-device
communication on a much smaller scale, facilitating direct interaction between
personal gadgets such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, wireless headphones
and wearable devices.
The primary goal ofa PAN is to enable the connection and communication of
personal devices for individual use, streamlining the sharing of data and access to
personal resources like contacts, internet access, and multimedia files. This network

type enhances personal productivity and entertainment by allowing seamless device
synchronization, data transfer and internet sharing in a highly localized setting.
Examples of PAN usage include:

*

headphones for music streaming

*

syncing a laptop with a wireless mouse and keyboard for an uncluttered
workspace

*

enabling a tablet to access the internet through a smartphone’s mobile data
connection.

A2.1 Network fundamentals

PANSs can be established using wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi Direct, which are specifically designed for short-range communication and
require minimal power, making them ideal for personal device connectivity.

Virtual private network (VPN)
Avirtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
network, allowing users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly
connected to the private network. A VPN can function over unlimited distances
since it uses the internet to create a secure and encrypted connection between
devices and the private network. This encryption ensures that data transmitted
over the VPN is protected from unauthorized access.
The primary goal of a VPN is to provide secure remote access to a private
network and its resources, such as files, printers, and software applications, from
any location with internet access. Remote workers, organizations with global
operations, and individuals concerned with privacy and security online all benefit
from VPNs. By creating a “tunnel” through the public internet that encrypts
data as it travels back and forth, VPNs ensure that sensitive information remains

confidential and secure from potential cyber threats.
Examples of VPN usage include:
*

employees accessing their company’s internal servers and documents
securely while working from home

*

individuals browsing the internet privately without revealing their IP address
or location

*

connecting to geo-restricted content by appearing to be in a different
geographical location.

VPNs can be implemented using software on devices such as laptops,
smartphones and tablets, or on routers to secure all traffic from a local network.

A2.1.2 Describe the purpose, benefits and
limitations of modern digital infrastructure
The term “infrastructure” refers to the basic physical and virtual components that
enable the operation and flow of digital data within a network. Infrastructure is the
backbone upon which digital services, applications and communications rely.
You can think ofa road system including highways and bridges as an example
of infrastructure. All kinds of cars and trucks can drive on the roads and over the
bridges. Network infrastructure is like the roads, highways and bridges, and the
cars and trucks are like the different network packets moving along the roads.

The internet
The internet is a global network of interconnected devices (routers, servers,

You will learn more about HTTP in
section A2.1.4.

computers) which exchange data using standardized protocols. For example, the
worldwide web (WWW) uses the internet as infrastructure to manage a global
network of hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)-based resources.
Purpose: The primary purpose of the internet is to facilitate reliable, fault-resistant
global communication and data exchange.
Benefits: The internet enables global communication and collaboration and
provides access to a vast amount of textual, video and audio data. Organizations
have used the internet to improve communication with customers and partners,
streamline operations and reduce costs and gather valuable customer insights.
The internet also enables educational materials and resources to be shared for
virtual teaching and learning.
Limitations: Bandwidth can vary greatly depending on geographical distance,
network congestion and the quality of infrastructure. The internet must evolve to
handle increasing amounts of data, connections and users without degradation
in performance or quality of service. Vulnerabilities can pose significant risks
to personal, organizational and national security. As critical infrastructure relies
on internet-connected systems, security and reliability become even more
important.

Cloud computing
Section Al.1.9 on computer
hardware in topic Al includes a
detailed discussion about cloud
computing.

Cloud computing is a network of remote servers (as opposed to local servers or
perscnal computers) accessible via the internet and used to store, manage and
process data. Cloud computing also offers software as a service, where users only
need a web browser
to connect and use software applications.
For example, schools can use cloud computing to reduce their need for
technical support and improve their resources management. Schools can pay
a subscription for cloud services rather than buying and managing expensive
servers themselves, which they may not need all the time. This saves time and
money on often tight budgets.
Purpose: The primary purpose of cloud computing is to provide scalable, ondemand access to computing resources and services.
Benefits: Cloud services can be scaled up or down based on demand, providing
businesses with flexibility in resource allocation and costs, as organizations
pay only for what they use. Cloud computing enables data and applications

104

A2.1 Network fundamentals

to be accessed from anywhere, at any time, enabling collaboration among
geographically dispersed teams. Cloud providers can offer data backup and
disaster recovery solutions, ensuring data integrity and minimizing downtime.
Limitations: Cloud services require reliable internet access. Limited or unreliable
connectivity can hinder access to cloud resources. Storing sensitive data off-site
raises concerns about data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. While
cloud providers implement robust security measures, the shared responsibility
model requires users to also secure their data.
High data-transfer volumes can incur significant costs. Additionally, bandwidth
limitations may affect data-intensive operations, reducing performance. For
applications that require real-time processing, the physical distance between the
cloud servers and end-users can introduce latency, affecting performance and
user experience.

Distributed systems
A distributed system is a network of independent computers that appear to the users
of the system as a single coherent system. When discussing a distributed system,
computers and devices within the system are referred to as nodes. These nodes
communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. The
more nodes in the system, the more powerful the computational resources.

Link

Centralized

Decentralized

Distributed

A Figure 3 The different configuration of nodes in centralized, decentralized, and
distributed networks

For example, Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework used for distributed
storage and processing of large data sets across clusters of computers. Itis
designed to scale out from a single server
to thousands of machines, each
offering local computation and storage. Adding more nodes directly translates to
increased processing power, storage capacity, and fault tolerance.
Purpose: The purpose ofa distributed system is to coordinate and distribute
processes and resources across multiple computers in a network, making them
work together to perform tasks more efficiently and reliably than could be
possible with a single computer.

105

A2 Networks

Benefits: Distributed systems enable the sharing of resources, providing
improved computational speed because tasks are distributed across multiple
nodes. This architecture enhances overall system performance and reliability
because if one component fails, the system as a whole can continue to operate
effectively. Furthermore, distributed systems facilitate flexible and efficient
processing by allowing systems to be expanded to accommodate increased
loads dynamically.
Limitations: One of the challenges of distributed systems is the complexity of
ensuring reliable communication and coordination between components over
unreliable networks. Ensuring data consistency
and managing concurrency
control in an environment where data might be replicated across multiple
nodes can be particularly challenging. Security concerns are also amplified in
distributed systems, since data is often transmitted over public networks and
stored on multiple machines, increasing the attack surface (the number of ways
threats can get into the system) for potential threats. The distributed nature
of these systems can introduce latency and potentially lower performance for
certain operations, compared with centralised systems. Additionally, the design
and maintenance of distributed systems require sophisticated algorithms and
mechanisms to manage the distribution of tasks, handle failures, and ensure data

integrity and security.

Edge computing
Edge computing involves processing data at or near the data source, rather
than relying solely on centralized cloud servers. This strategy decreases the
physical distance data must travel, leading to faster processing times and
lower latency, which is particularly beneficial for applications requiring realtime responses.

For example, think about a smart traffic light system which gathers data about
traffic and then changes the timing of the lights to improve the flow of traffic.
Where should the processing happen—far away in a remote data centre or
next to the traffic lights? Edge computing brings processing near
to the data,
speeding up the system.
Licence plate recognition systems are another example. Instead of sending raw
video feeds to a distant server, the camera sends the processed data (digitized
number plates) because the data has been processed near the source.
Purpose: The core aim of edge computing is to bring data processing closer
to where the data is generated (the data source). This reduces reliance on a
central data-processing warehouse. This decentralization is intended to improve
response times and save bandwidth, providing real-time data analysis and
processing.

Benefits: Edge computing allows for faster data processing and response
times by minimizing the distance data travels. It enhances the efficiency of data
transmission for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles and internet
of things (loT) devices. By processing data locally, edge computing reduces
the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud, decreasing bandwidth
usage and associated costs. It also increases the reliability of data services, as
local data processing continues to function even if connectivity to a central

keeping sensitive data on-site, reducing exposure to potential breaches during
transmission.
Limitations: The management and maintenance of distributed computing
resources can be complex, requiring advanced coordination and automation
tools. Security is a double-edged sword: while keeping data local can enhance
privacy, it also necessitates robust security measures on numerous devices

that might be vulnerable to attack. The initial setup and operational costs
can be high, given the need for additional computing resources at multiple
locations. Furthermore, there can be inconsistency in computing capabilities
across different edge devices, affecting the uniformity of data processing
and application perfarmance. Ensuring data consistency across distributed
networks also poses a challenge, particularly in environments requiring real-time
synchronization across devices.

Mobile networks
Mabile networks are telecommunications networks designed for the connectivity
of maobile devices, enabling voice, data, and multimedia communication over

significant distances without the need for physical connections. Mobile networks
are cellular, covering broad geographical areas and supporting connections for
a large number of users with the ability to hand off connections from one cell to
another as users move, maintaining seamless connectivity.

Purpose: The purpose of mobile networks is to provide wireless communication
services across wide areas, facilitating connectivity for mobile devices anywhere
within the coverage area. This enables seamless communication, internet access
and data exchange on the go, supporting the increasing mobility of society and
the growing demand for constant connectivity.
Benefits: Mobile networks offer the convenience of wireless communication,

allowing users to stay connected anywhere there is network coverage. They
support a wide range of services, from voice calls and text messaging to highspeed internet access and streaming of multimedia content. The evolution of
mobile networks, from 2G to 5G technologies, has significantly enhanced data
transmission speeds and reduced latency, improving the user experience for
mobile internet services. These networks also enable a vast ecosystem of mobile
applications and services, driving innovation in fields such as mobile commerce,
telemedicine and remote work.
Limitations: Despite their advantages, mobile networks face several limitations.
Coverage gaps or “dead zones" can occur in areas where network signals are
obstructed or too far from a cell tower, leading to connectivity issues. The quality
of service can vary due to factors such as network congestion, particularly in
crowded areas or during peak usage times, impacting data speeds and call
quality. Upgrading network infrastructure to newer technologies (for example,
from 4G to 5G) requires substantial investment, and the deployment of these
advanced networks is often gradual, leading to disparities in service availability.
Maobile networks also have inherent security vulnerabilities that can expose
users to risks such as eavesdropping, data breaches, and other cyber threats.
Additionally, the reliance on finite radio frequency spectrum resources can limit
the capacity of mobile networks, necessitating efficient spectrum management
and technological innovations to meet growing demand.

a network.

Gateways

——

Gateways are network devices that act as a bridge between two networks that

m’ﬁ&"‘.’

use disparate protocols. Gateways are used in scenarios where data needs to be
translated from one format to another or when different networking technologies

A Figure 4 A gateway

need to interact.
Usage scenarios
A gateway can enable communication between an office network and the
internet, converting private network addresses to a public address using
protocols such as NAT (network address translation). Additionally, gateways
might incorporate security functions, filtering, and traffic management to enhance
data flow and security across the networks they bridge.
A gateway can also be used to convert data between different network
protocols. For example, a gateway might translate email traffic from the simple
mail transfer protocol (SMTP) on an enterprise network to another messaging
protocol used by an external network, facilitating seamless communication
between different email systems.
Within the context of voice over internet protocol (VolP) communications, a
gateway can translate between the digital signals used within an IP network and
the analogue signals of traditional phone lines. This enables calls to be made
between internet-based VolP users and traditional telephone users.
In industrial environments, a gateway can bridge the communication gap
between a factory’s control system and the machines on the production floor,
which may use differing communication standards or protocols (for example,
translating between Ethernet/IP and a legacy protocol such as Modbus). This
helps integrate older machinery into modern control architectures without
replacing expensive equipment.

A2.1 Network fundamentals

Hardware firewalls
Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and
outgoing network traffic (packets) based on predetermined security rules.
A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and
untrusted external networks, such as the internet, to block malicious traffic and

prevent unauthorized access.

Usage scenarios

A Figure 5 A firewall device

A primary use ofa hardware firewall is to protect an organization’s network by filtering
traffic at the packet level. For example, a firewall can block traffic coming from
suspicious sources or containing harmful data, preventing attacks on the network.
In scenarios involving network traffic pricritization, firewalls can implement quality
of service (QoS) rules to ensure critical applications—such as VolP calls or video

conferencing—receive priority over less critical traffic. By analysing and classifying
packets, a firewall can allocate higher bandwidth to these priority packets, reducing
latency and improving overall performance for essential services.
For example, your school might prioritize network traffic to educational sites and
deprioritize traffic to a gaming site. This ensures valid traffic has enough bandwidth.
In a home environment, a firewall can be integrated into the broadband router

to provide basic network protection against external threats. It can prevent
potentially harmful communications from entering the home network and can
also manage parental controls to restrict access to inappropriate content.
Software and hardware firewalls
Software firewalls are installed as an application on an individual device,
controlling incoming and outgoing traffic at the device level based on predefined
security rules. They are suitable for providing customized security settings for
specific applications and are particularly useful in protecting individual devices
from internal threats and unauthorized software actions.
Hardware firewalls are standalone physical units that sit between an entire
network and the external world. They manage all the traffic entering and exiting
the network through a centralized point, providing broader protection against
external threats. These firewalls are designed to handle a higher volume oftraffic
without impacting the performance of individual network devices.
Software firewalls offer detailed control over individual device activities, while
hardware firewalls provide comprehensive protection at the network perimeter
for the entire network.

Modems
Modems (modulator-demodulators) are devices that facilitate data transmission

over telephone lines or broadband connections by converting digital data from
a computer into analogue signals suitable for sending over these lines, and vice
versa. They serve as a bridge between the digital data networks and analogue
phone systems.

A Figure 6 A modem

Usage scenarios
One primary function of modems is to provide internet connectivity in residential
and business environments by interfacing with a service provider's network via
standard telephone lines, cable, or satellite connections.

109

A2 Networks

For example, a cable modem converts the digital signals from a router
to
analogue signals that are suitable for transmission over cable television
infrastructure.
In telecommunication setups, modems enable dial-up access to the internet,
where they convert the digital data from a computer to an analogue signal that
can travel over public switched telephone networks (PSTN). The modem then
demodulates the incoming analogue signal back into digital form at the receiving
end, allowing for two-way internet communication.
Modems are also instrumental in scenarios involving remote management
and telemetry, where they send and receive data to control or monitor remote
equipment or systems via telephone lines. This is common in industries such as
utilities or services that require remote system diagnostics and updates.

Network interface cards (NICs)
Network interface cards (NICs) are hardware components within a computer

or network device which facilitate the interface between the physical network
and the device's processing capabilities. NICs perform the critical function of
converting electrical signals received from the network into digital data that the
computer’s processor can understand and vice versa. This conversion is essential
forthe communication process over computer networks.

A Figure 7 An older style NIC

Media access control (MAC)
address A unique identifier assigned
to a network interface card (NIC)
for communications on a physical
network. Itis a 48-bit hexadecimal
number typically written as six

pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g.,
00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E) and is used to

ensure that data is sent to the correct
device on a local network.

Atits core, a NIC converts raw data signals from the network into usable digital data.
For Ethernet NICs, this involves translating the electrical signals transmitted over
copper cables into digital data the device's operating system can process. Similarly,
forfibre-optic NICs, the NIC converts light signals into digital data. Wireless NICs, or
Wi-Fi adapters, function by converting radio frequency signals into digital data.
NICs handle both the transmission and reception of data packets. Each NIC has
a transmitter and a receiver, which work simultaneously to send out digital data
converted into signals and to receive incoming signals converting them back into
digital data.
Integral to its operation, each NIC possesses a unique media access control
(MAC) address. This address identifies the device on the local network. During

data transmission, the MAC address is used to ensure that data packets are
delivered to the correct hardware destination on a local network segment.
NICs also incorporate buffers which store data temporarily as it is being sent
or received, which helps manage data flow and prevent loss during high traffic
periods. Additionally, NICs perform error checking to ensure data integrity,
using protocols such as cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to detect errors in the
data packets.

Routers
Routers are network devices which manage the exchange of data between
different networks. They direct data packets between networks by determining the
optimal paths for data transmission, using routing protocols and routing tables.

A Figure 8 A router

110

At its core, a router examines the destination |P address within each data packet
and uses this information, along with a routing table, to determine the best next
hop for the packet. Routers maintain and update their routing tables through
dynamic or static routing protocols, which help them learn network paths and
make intelligent routing decisions.

A2.1 Network fundamentals

Routers are responsible for receiving, processing and forwarding data packets to
their correct destinations. A packet might pass through many routers to reach its
destination. Routers inspect each packet’s header to make routing decisions and
use protocols such as routing information protocol (RIP) to find the fastest path
to the destination.

Usage scenarios
In a residential setting, routers connect multiple devices to the internet and each
other, creating a local network. Home routers often come with built-in wireless
access points to support Wi-Fi connectivity.
In business environments, routers connect the enterprise network to the internet

or other branch networks over large geographic distances. These routers are
more robust and have complex configurations to handle the greater security and
traffic management needs of business operations.
High-capacity routers are used by internet service providers (ISPs) and large
enterprises to direct internet traffic across the globe. These routers handle
massive amounts of data and use complex routing algorithms to maintain internet
connectivity and performance.

Switches
Switches are networking devices that connect devices within a LAN. Switches
manage the flow of data within a network by receiving, processing and
forwarding data packets (also called frames) to the correct destination device.
At their core, switches receive incoming data packets from one device and use
the MAC address information contained within the packet to forward it to the
appropriate destination device.
A Figure 9 A switch with Ethernet cables

Switches maintain a MAC address table, also known as a forwarding table, which

maps each MAC address to the corresponding switch port. This allows the switch
to effectively direct traffic by looking up the destination MAC address of each
frame and forwarding the frame directly to the port associated with that address.
While switches are efficient at directing traffic, they must handle broadcasts
(sent to all devices) and multicasts (sent to a group of devices) differently.
For these types of traffic, the switch forwards the frames to multiple ports based
on the needs of the network protocol being used.

Usage scenarios
In a small office or home office, a switch can connect multiple devices, such as

computers, printers and storage devices, allowing them to share resources and
communicate efficiently.

112

A2.1 Network fundamentals

In larger enterprise networks, switches are part ofa more complex network
infrastructure that includes multiple switches and routers. Here, switches can

be configured for advanced functions such as VLAN segmentation and link
aggregation to enhance network security, performance and reliability.
In data centre environments, switches play a critical role in managing data traffic
between servers and storage systems. High-performance switches in data centres
often support additional features such as high-speed throughput rates, low
latency, and the handling of large volumes of data traffic.
In schools and universities, switches are used to connect and manage traffic

across campus networks, supporting connectivity
for thousands of devices used
by students, faculty and staff.

Wireless access points (WAPs)
Wireless access points (WAPs) serve as the interface between the wired

infrastructure and wireless devices. WAPs convert wired Ethernet data into
wireless signals and vice versa, effectively extending the reach of the network to
areas where wiring is impractical, impossible or undesirable.
WAPs broadcast wireless signals that wireless devices can detect and connect to.
They operate by receiving data packets from the wired network, converting these
packets into radio frequencies, and transmitting them wirelessly. The process is
reversed for incoming signals from wireless devices, which are converted back
into data packets and relayed onto the wired network.
WAPs integrate with the existing network infrastructure using standard network
protocols. They can support various security standards such as WPA, WPA2 or
WPAZ3 to ensure encrypted connections.

A Figure 10

AWAP

In larger installations, multiple WAPs can be configured to create a wireless network
mesh. This setup allows users to move between different areas (for example,
between floors or rooms in a building) without losing connection, as their devices
automatically switch to the strongest available signal from the nearest WAP.
WAPs can be managed centrally, often via controllers that configure settings, manage
network policies and provide tools for monitoring network usage and performance.
This central management helps maintain consistent configurations across multiple
WAPs and simplifies the task of updating network settings orfirmware.

Usage scenarios
In office environments, WAPs provide employees with the flexibility to connect to
the network from anywhere in the building without the need for physical cables,
enhancing mobility and collaboration.
Schools and universities use WAPs to cover extensive campus areas, providing
students and staff with access to educational resources and the internet from
classrooms, libraries and outdoor spaces.
WAPs are widely used in retail environments and public areas such as airports and
cafes to offer free Wi-Fi access to customers, improving visitor satisfaction and
enabling additional services such as location-based advertising.
In residential settings, WAPs enhance the convenience of wireless connectivity
within the home, supporting a wide range of devices including smartphones,
tablets and home automation systems.

A2.1 Network fundamentals

A2.1.4 Describe the network protocols used
for transport and application
A protocol is a set of rules and standards which defines how data should be
structured, transmitted and received across a network. Protocols determine format,

timing, sequencing and error checking of data as it is transmitted between devices.
Protocols can be stateful or stateless. A stateful protocol maintains state
information about the client-server session across multiple requests and
responses. A stateless protocol does not maintain information about sessions.
Each communication session is essentially treated as a blank slate.

Transmission control protocol (TCP)
Transmission control protocol (TCP) is a core protocol of the internet. It operates
at the transport layer of the TCP model and provides reliable, ordered and errorchecked delivery of a stream of bytes between hosts communicating via an IP

This topicis covered in greater
detail in section A2.1.5.

network. Key features include connection establishment (handshake process), data

transfer with acknowledgment, flow control (preventing network congestion) and
connection termination. It is used where data integrity and the delivery order of
packets are important.

User datagram protocol (UDP)
User datagram protocol (UDP) enables a connectionless mode of communication

whereby data packets, or datagrams, are sent between devices without
establishing or maintaining a stateful connection between the communication
endpoints. This approach contrasts with the connection-criented method
employed by TCP, which requires a connection to be established before data
can be exchanged.
UDP’s connectionless nature makes it faster and less resource-intensive than TCP
because it eliminates the overhead associated with setting up and maintaining a
connection. This efficiency is particularly valuable in scenarios where occasional
data loss is tolerable. Therefore, UDP is widely favoured for real-time applications
such as video streaming, online gaming and VolP. In these use cases, the priority
is on reducing latency and maintaining continuous flow of data, even if it means
some packets are lost or arrive out of order.
UDP also supports multicasting—the transmission of a packet to multiple
destinations in a single send operation—making it suitable for applications
such as live broadcasts and group collaborations. Despite its simplicity,
UDP’s utility in specific contexts—where the overhead of guaranteed delivery
is an unnecessary burden—makes it an indispensable part of the network
communications landscape.

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the foundational protocol for data
communication over the worldwide web (WWW). It delineates the exact structure

and encoding of data transferred between web servers and browsers, facilitating
the transfer of web pages as HTTP messages. The messages sent by a client (usually
aweb browser) are termed HTTP requests, and the messages sent by the server in
response are called HTTP responses. Responses are often preceded by response
codes, some of which you may have seen as you have used the worldwide web.

A2 Networks

REDIRECTION

INFORMATIONAL
SERVER ERROR

A Figure 11 HTTP responses

Table 2 Some common HTTP response codes
HTTP response code | Description
200 0K

Indicates that the request has succeeded and the
server has returned the expected content.

404 Not Found

The server cannot find the requested resource. Often
triggered by broken links or incorrect URL input.

500 Internal Server Error | A generic error message indicating that the
server encountered an unexpected condition that
prevented it from fulfilling the request.
301 Moved Permanently | This response code is used when the requested
resource has been permanently moved to a new
URL, and any future references should use one of the
returned URLs.
403 Forbidden

The server understands the request but refuses to
authorize it. This often occurs when access to the
requested resource is restricted or denied.

This protocol operates primarily using a request/response model. A client sends
an HTTP request to the server, which includes a method (for example, GET to
fetch resources, POST to submit data), a header (which conveys metadata such

as content type and authentication information), and sometimes a body (which
contains data being sent to the server). The server processes this request and
returns an HTTP response, which includes a status code (indicating success or
failure), response headers (similar to request headers but for response settings),

and usually a response body containing the requested resource or error details.
This model is fundamental for web interactions, enabling the vast array of web
functionalities available.
HTTP is characterized as a stateless protocol, which means that each request
made by a client is processed by the server independently, without any inherent
knowledge or memory of previous interactions.
This stateless nature requires that any session information needed to be maintained
must be included in the HTTP messages themselves or handled by external
mechanisms such as cookies.

116

A2.1 Network fundamentals

Cookies are files stored on the client’s device which store state information. They
are sent with requests to enable stateful communication. Sessions are useful in
web applications because they allow the server
to maintain user-specific data
across multiple HTTP requests (if you are logged in, what you last looked at in an
online store, what time zone you are in, and so on).

HTTP state management refers to the methods and techniques used to maintain
the state ofa user’s interaction with a web application across multiple HTTP
requests. A common example of state management is the use of cookies, which
store data on the client’s browser to help maintain continuity between requests.

Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)
Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the basic HTTP,
specifically designed to enhance security for communications over the worldwide
web. HTTPS incorporates encryption into the data transmission process to protect the

section A2.4.4.

A Figure 12 HTTP and HTTPS protocols

The security in HTTPS is achieved through the transport layer security (TLS) protocal,
and formerly through its predecessor, the secure sockets layer (SSL). These protocols
encrypt the data before it is sent over the internet and decrypt it upon arrival at its
destination. This encryption process ensures that even if the data is intercepted
during transmission it remains unreadable and secure from unauthorized access.
The use of HTTPS is indicated in the scheme ofa URL of a website with the

HTTPS significantly enhances the security of web interactions by safeguarding
against eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery, thereby providing a
trusted foundation for secure communication on the worldwide web.

Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)
Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses and
other essential network configuration parameters to devices when they connecttoa
network. This automatic configuration is helpful when a device, such as a computer or
smartphone, first connects to a network, ensuring it receives the appropriate network
configuration settings to communicate effectively with other devices.
The primary function of DHCP is to simplify network administration. Without
DHCP, network administrators would need to manually assign IP addresses
to each new device joining the network—a time-consuming and error-prone
process. DHCP automates this task, ensuring efficient and correct configuration
without manual intervention.

A Figure 13 DHCP stands for Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol

When a device connects to a network, it sends a broadcast query requesting the
necessary information. In response, the DHCP server assigns an IP address to the

device from a predefined range of addresses, known as a scope.

N7

A2 Networks

In addition to the IP address, DHCP also provides other configuration details vital
for network communication, such as the following.

Domain name system (DNS) server addresses, which are used to resolve
domain names into IP addresses.

DHCP can allocate IP addresses in two primary manners.
*

Dynamic allocation is when DHCP assigns an IP address to a device fora
limited period, known as a “lease.” Once the lease expires, the device must
request a new IP address, although often the same IP may be reassigned
if still available. This method is particularly useful in environments with
frequently changing devices, like guest Wi-Fi networks.

»

Staticallocation is when DHCP assigns a permanent P address to a device
based on its MAC address. This method is used for devices that require a
consistent IP address, such as network printers or servers.

By managing IP address distribution and network settings, DHCP helps prevent
address conflicts (where two devices on the same network end up with the
same |P address) and reduces the overhead associated with network resource

management. This capability is integral to maintaining smooth network
operations, particularly in large-scale or rapidly changing network environments.

A2.1.5 Describe the function of the

TCP/IP model
Digital networks are complex, interdependent systems with many different
devices, protocols, transmission media, and potential problems. Because
networks are so complex, conceptual models are used to aid understanding,
characterizing, troubleshooting and standardizing network operations.
A well-known conceptual model is the TCP/IP model.

118

A2.1 Network fundamentals

Each layer of the model articulates a specific networking activity. In other words,
at each layer, something happens to a message before it is passed to the next
layer. Normally, network traffic goes through layers sequentially. As a message is
received by a computer it travels from the bottom up and, as a message is sent, it
travels from the top down.

Role

Application layer

Provides the interface between the applications on a computer and the
network. It defines protocols which applications use to exchange data over
the network, such as HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, DNS, DHCP and

simple network management protocol (SNMP) which is used for managing and monitoring
network devices.
Transport layer

Facilitates direct communication services for application processes across various hosts.

(TCP and UDP)

Transmission control protocol (TCP) employs sequencing, checksums, acknowledgments, and

retransmissions to guarantee orderly and error-free data delivery to the destination.
User datagram protocol (UDP) offers a quicker but less reliable service compared to TCP.
Internet layer

Handles the packetization, addressing, and routing of data across different networks to ensure
it reaches its intended destination. The primary protocol in this layer is the internet protocol (IP),
which defines IP addresses that uniquely identify each device on the network.

Network interface layer | Concerns itself with the physical and hardware aspects of network communication. It handles
how data is physically transmitted over the network media, including aspects such as cable
specifications, signal encoding and decoding, data framing, and MAC addressing for
Ethernet networks. This layer is where network adapters (such as Ethernet cards and drivers)
operate, interfacing directly with the physical network medium (such as copper wires, fibreoptic cables, or wireless signals). Protocols used at this layer include 802.3 (ethernet) and

802.11 (wireless).
Reliability comes from the TCP/IP model'’s layered approach, where each
layer’s specific protocols dictate precisely how data should be handled,
encapsulated, transmitted, and received. Error-checking, checksums,

sequencing and acknowledgments of messages all add to the reliability of

the data sent via TCP/IP.

A Figure 15 The different steps of the TCP/IP model

Here is a description of the steps shown in Figure 15.
Step 1. Application layer: User requests a web page
a.

The user enters a URL in their web browser and presses enter or clicks.

b.

At the application layer the web browser (application) constructs an HTTP
GET request to retrieve the web page. This request is prepared according to
the HTTP protocol operating at the application layer.

C.

The request is passed down to the transport layer.

Step 2. Transport layer: Preparing the request for transmission
a.

At the transport layer, the HTTP request is handed down from
the application layer, where itis changed into a segment (called a TCP
segment). Each segment is given a TCP header, which includes sequencing
information, source, and destination port numbers (e.g., port 80 for HTTP,
port 443 for HTTPS), and a checksum for error checking.

A TCP connection is established using a three-way handshake process. SYN,
SYN-ACK, and ACK packets are exchanged between the client and server to
establish a reliable connection.
i.

SYN (synchronization)
The client begins the process by sending a SYN segment to the
destination server. “Hey, | want to talk, do you want to talk?”

ii.

SYN-ACK (synchronization-acknowledgement)
The destination server receives the SYN segment and responds with a
SYN-ACK segment. “Ok, | got your message, yes, |'m ready to hear
your message.”

iii. ACK(acknowledgement)
The client receives the server’s SYN-ACK and sends a final ACK segment.
“Great. | understand you are ready to talk, and I'm going to start
sending data!”

120

A2.1 Network fundamentals

After the three-way handshake, the TCP connection is considered
established, and data transfer, like our HTTP GET request, can proceed. The

segment is passed down to the internet layer. If for some reason the TCP
handshake fails, the request will not be passed to the internet layer and the
user might encounter a “connection timed out” message.
Step 3. Internet layer: Preparing the segment for routing
d.

At the internet layer, each TCP segment is encapsulated within an IP packet,
which includes the IP address of the source (the user’s device) and the P
address of the destination (the web server). In addition, IP packets contain
the protocol (the type of data encapsulated, in this case, TCP), atime to live

(TTL), which prevents packets from circulating indefinitely on the network,
and a header checksum for error detection in the IP header itself.
At this layer, the packet is also assigned a next hop (where should this packet
be sent to next), which is usually the address of the router on your network.
After the packet has been created, it is passed down to the network interface
layer.
Step 4. Network interface layer: Final encapsulation and converting to signal
d.

The network interface layer encapsulates the IP packet (which contains
the TCP segment and HTTP request) into an Ethernet frame (assuming you
are on an Ethernet network). This frame includes destination MAC address
(the MAC address of the next hop device), the MAC address of your own
machine, and control information and a checksum for error detection.

At this point, the frame is physically transmitted.
i.

The network interface card (NIC) converts the Ethernet frame into
electrical signals (or light pulses, for example, depending on the
medium) suitable for the physical network connection.

ii.

The signals representing the frame are finally transmitted over
the physical medium, be it an Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi signal,
or other technology.

Please keep in mind the network interface layer is where the protocols and
operations become specific to the type of physical network (Ethernet, Wi-Fi,
fibre-optic).
Between steps 4 and 5, the next part happens outside of your computer
and network: The frame is routed through the internet, potentially
hopping through multiple routers, until it reaches the server. Each router
uses the frame’s destination IP address to determine the next hop towards
the destination.

121

A2 Networks

Step 5. Receiving the request on the server

_

’

Broadcast address The broadcast
address is used to communicate
with all devices on a network. ltis

identified by having all host bits
setto 1.

At the network interface layer, the server’s NIC receives the electrical
(or other) signals from the physical network and converts them into
an Ethernet frame. The NIC checks the frame checksum to ensure no
errors occurred during transmission. If errors are detected, the frame
is discarded. The NIC examines the destination MAC address. Ifit
matches the server’'s MAC address (or a broadcast address), the frame
is processed further. The netwark interface layer strips off the Ethernet
header and trailer, leaving the IP packet, and passes the frame to the
internet layer.
At the internet layer, the server’s IP layer examines the destination IP
address in the packet header. If it matches the server’s own IP address,

the packet is accepted. The IP header checksum is calculated to verify the
header's integrity. Corrupted packets are discarded. Finally, the IP layer
removes the IP header, exposing the encapsulated TCP segment. The TCP
segment is passed to the transport layer.
At the transport layer, the TCP layer looks at the destination port number
in the TCP segment header. This directs the data to the correct application
process listening on that port (port 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). If the
HTTP GET request was split into multiple TCP segments, the TCP layer uses
the sequence numbers to reassemble the data in the correct order. The
TCP checksum is calculated to ensure no errors were introduced during
transmission. Corrupted segments are typically discarded or trigger requests
for retransmission. If the TCP segment checksums are valid and the data is
successfully reassembled, the intact HTTP GET request is handed up to the
application layer.
Step 6. Server responds with the web page
a.

At the application layer, the web server software generates an HTTP
response, containing the requested web page’s HTML content.
At the transport layer, the HTTP response is changed to a TCP segment,
encapsulated with TCP headers, and the segments are sent back to
the client.
At the internet layer, the response TCP segments are encapsulated within
IP packets.
At the network interface layer, the packets are converted to frames and
changed into signals, and are then transmitted.

Step 7. User receives the web page
d.

At the network interface layer, the user’s network interface card (NIC)
receives the electrical (or other) signals from the physical network and
converts them into an Ethernet frame. After checking the frame, it is

discarded, and the IP packet is sent up to the internet layer.

122

A2.1 Network fundamentals

b.

Theinternet layer inspects and then removes the IP header, exposing the
encapsulated TCP segment. The TCP segment is passed to the transport
layer.

c.

Atthetransportlayer, if the TCP segment checksums are valid and the data
is successfully reassembled the intact HTTP GET request is handed up to the
application layer.

d.

Atthe application layer, the web browser interprets the HTML content and
displays the web page to the user.

Step 8. Connection termination
Finally, after the web page is successfully transmitted, the TCP connection is
closed through a connection termination process, where FIN and ACK packets
are exchanged to gracefully close the connection.
a.

AFIN packet signals that the sender (either the client or the server) has
finished sending data and wants to gracefully close the connection in one
direction.

b.

An ACK packet confirms the receipt of data.

TOK
The process of transmitting a web page from a server
to a client involves
multiple layers of communication, each handling specific tasks to ensure
accurate data transfer. This intricate process underscores the complexity and
efficiency of modern networking protocols.
To what extent do we rely on invisible systems in our daily lives, and how does
our understanding of these systems (or lack thereof) affect our trust in them?

Syllabus understandings
A2.2.1 Describe the functions and practical applications of network topologies
A2.2.2 Describe the function of servers
A2.2.3 Compare and contrast networking models
A2.2.4 Explain the concepts and applications of network segmentation
Network architecture refers to the overall design of a network, encompassing its
components, layers, protocals, and how they interact.

A2.2.1 Describe the functions and practical
applications of network topologies
Network topology is the arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections
(links) within a network. Topology can be physical or logical. Physical topology
refers to the actual layout of cables, wires, routers, switches and other hardware

components. Logical topology refers to how data flows across the network,
regardless of the physical arrangement of devices.

Star topology
A star topology is a configuration where each device connects directlyto a
central device (usually a switch). This creates a star-shape with the central device
at the centre.

Reliability of star topologies is high, since each device is independently
connected. A single cable or device failure will not take down the entire network.
Only the affected device becomes isolated. Of course, if the central switch or hub
fails, the whole network fails.

A Figure16 Astartopology

Transmission speed is generally fast. Modern switches and hubs minimize
transmission delays. Direct connections between devices and the central node
reduce the potential for bottlenecks that might occur in other topologies.
The scalability of star topologies is good, and adding or removing devices is as
simple as connecting a new device to an available port on the central switch.
However, central switches have a finite number of ports, ultimately limiting how
many devices you can add.

124

A2.2 Network architecture

Data collisions are rare because modern switches largely eliminate collisions by
managing traffic effectively.
The cost of star topologies can be high because they require more cabling than
some alternatives. Each device has its own dedicated line to the centre.
A common example ofa star topology is a home network. Most home networks
use a star topology with a central router or wireless access point. Business LANs
often use a star topology, with computers and other network devices connecting
to centrally managed switches.

Mesh topology
Mesh topology is where devices (called nodes) connect directly to as many other
nodes as possible. This creates a mesh-like structure. Full mesh networks are
when every node is connected to every other node. Partial node networks are
when nodes are connected to some but not all other nodes.
Reliability of mesh topologies is very high. If one node fails or a connection
is broken, data can be automatically rerouted through other nodes. This
redundancy provides resilience. Reliability is improved because there is no single
point of failure like a central switch.
A Figure 17 A mesh topology

Transmission speed depends on factors such as the number of hops data takes,
the strength of connections between nodes, and network traffic. (A hop refers
to data packets being transmitted from one device, such as a router, switch or
gateway, to another device.) Mesh networks can be fast, but may also experience
some slowdown on heavily used paths.
Scalability of mesh topologies involves adding nodes, powering them on,
and placing them within range. Many mesh protocols facilitate automatic
configuration, making scalability very easy.
Intelligent routing algorithms in mesh networks help find the most efficient data
paths, reducing the chances of multiple signals competing on the same channel.
This makes data collisions uncommon.
The cost ofa mesh network depends on the type of nodes used. Simple mesh
systems can be affordable, while more sophisticated enterprise-grade nodes will
be more expensive.
Common examples of mesh topologies include modern Wi-Fi mesh systems
(such as Google Nest, Eero) and some communities use mesh networks to

provide internet access in areas with limited infrastructure. Mesh networks can
provide reliable connectivity for sensors and other devices in manufacturing or
warehousing environments.

125

A2 Networks

Hybrid network
Hybrid networks combine elements from different networking topologies (such
as star and mesh) to optimize performance, reliability and scalability based on
specific needs and conditions. Hybrid networks are designed to leverage the
strengths of multiple topology types, avoiding the limitations inherent to any
single topology. For example, a hybrid network might use a star topology for its
core infrastructure, connecting main servers and routers, while employing a mesh
topology for peripheral devices to ensure robustness and redundancy.

—
TN

e
A Figure 18 Hybrid network topology

The reliability of hybrid networks is typically very high, benefiting from the
combined strengths ofthe incorporated topologies. The presence of multiple
paths for data transmission ensures that the network can maintain connectivity
even if certain components fail. This redundancy, drawn from mesh topology
aspects, alongside the centralized management from a star or bus topology,
ensures a balance between resilience and control.
Transmission speeds in hybrid networks can vary, influenced by the network'’s
specific configuration and the topologies it integrates. The use of direct
connections in certain segments (akin to mesh topology) can enhance speed
and reduce hops, while centralized elements might streamline data routing and
management, improving overall efficiency.
Hybrid networks offer flexible scalability options, allowing expansion in a manner
that aligns with the network’s evolving needs. Adding new devices or nodes
can be facilitated through the easier-to-scale components of the network, such
as those based on mesh or star topologies. This enables the network to grow or
reconfigure without significant disruptions to existing operations.

126

A2.2 Network architecture

The incorporation of intelligent routing algorithms is important in hybrid
networks, managing the complexity of data paths across different topologies.
These algorithms optimize the routing of data packets, taking into account
the diverse characteristics of the network's parts to enhance performance and
minimise collisions and congestion.
The cost of implementing and maintaining a hybrid network can vary widely,
depending on the complexity of the design and the types of topologies
integrated. While the flexibility of hybrid networks allows for cost-effective
solutions by combining inexpensive and more costly components judiciously, the
overall expense can be higher than that of more straightforward network designs
due to increased management and maintenance requirements.
Hybrid networks are particularly useful in complex environments where no single
topology meets all the requirements. Examples include large corporate networks
that use a combination of star topology
for central offices and mesh topology for
connecting remote workstations and devices. Similarly, smart cities might employ
hybrid networks to integrate various services and infrastructure needs, ensuring
robustness, flexibility and coverage.

A2.2.2 Describe the function of servers
A server is a computer system (either hardware or software) that delivers data,

resources or services to other computers (known as clients) over a network.
Any computer can be a server, but servers are generally different from desktop
or laptop computers you might use. They are designed for very high reliability,
fault-tolerance and robust performance.

Domain name system (DNS) server
The function ofa DNS server is to translate human-readable domain names (such
as www.google.com) into their corresponding numerical IP addresses (such
as 172.217.16.14). This translation is required for address resolution and packet
routing to work (see A1.2.5). If your local DNS server cannot find the IP address
fora domain name you have requested, it employs recursion by querying higherlevel DNS servers within the internet’s hierarchical structure until it locates the
server that can provide the correct IP address.

127

A2 Networks

A DNS lookup
1.

Entera domain name (such as www.google.com) into your web browser.

2.

The request for the domain name’s IP address is sent to your local DNS
server, which is typically operated by your internet service provider.

3.

Thelocal DNS server checks its cache to see if it has a recent record of the IP
address for the domain name. If it finds the address in its cache, it returns the

IP address to your computer, and the process ends here.
4.

Recursive query:
a.

Ifthe P addressis notin the cache, the local DNS server sends a query
to a root DNS server. The root server does not know the IP address
but directs your local DNS to a top-level domain (TLD) server
(for example, for .com domains).

b.

The TLD server, in turn, does not store the IP address but directs to
the authoritative DNS server
for the domain (which knows the actual

IP address).
5.

Authoritative DNS server:

a.

The local DNS server then queries the authoritative DNS server for the
domain name you requested.

b.

The authoritative server returns the corresponding IP address back to
your local DNS server.

c.

The local DNS server caches the IP address for the specified time
(defined by the time to live (TTL) in the DNS record) to speed up
future requests.

6.

The local DNS server sends the IP address back to your computer. Your
browser can now use this IP address to connect to the web server hosting the
website you requested.

7.

Your browser sends a request to the web server at the resolved IP address to
load the web page.

DNS servers are spread throughout the world, ensuring that requests can be
answered from geographically close locations, reducing latency. DNS servers
store resolved domain-name-to-IP address mappings fora period of time. This
means frequently requested domain names can be served quickly from the
cache, reducing the load on the broader DNS system. For example, once your
DNS server knows acm.org can be reached at IP address 104.17.78.30, it does
not need to look it up again fora while. Large DNS providers use load balancing
techniques to distribute requests across multiple servers, preventing any single
server from becoming overloaded.
DNS systems use multiple servers with replicated data. If one server fails, others
can still provide resolutions. Top-level root servers are particularly resilient, using
multiple, geographically distributed servers to protect against failures.
You learned about DHCP in section

A2.1.1.

128

Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server
The function of a DHCP server is to automatically assign IP addresses and other
network configuration parameters to devices on a network, enabling them to
communicate with other IP networks.

A2.2 Network architecture

When a device connects to the network, it requests networking settings from
the DHCP server. The DHCP server selects an available IP address from its pool
and assigns it to the device, along with other necessary configuration information
such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. This process is
known as obtaining a DHCP lease.

The DORA process
Discovery, offer, request and acknowledgment (DORA) is used by DHCP to
assign IP addresses to devices on a network automatically.
*

Discovery: The client sends a broadcast packet (DHCPDISCOVER) to locate
available DHCP servers.

e

Offer: DHCP servers respond to the client with an offer (DHCPOFFER) that
contains an |P address the client can use.

*

Request: The client responds to an offer by requesting (DHCPREQUEST) the
IP address from one of the servers.

*

Acknowledgment: The server confirms (OHCPACK) the IP address has
been assigned to the client for a specific lease time.

DHCP servers are configured to manage a range of IP addresses and distribute
them as needed to client devices. This automated management simplifies the
process of connecting new devices to the network, ensures that each device has
a unigue |IP address, and reduces the potential for configuration errors.
For example, when a new smartphone connects to a Wi-Fi network, it sends a
DHCP discover message. The DHCP server responds with an offer that includes
an IP address and other network settings. Once the smartphone accepts the
offer, the server sends an acknowledgment, and the smartphone can then
communicate on the network using the assigned IP address.
DHCP servers can be set up to assign addresses dynamically (choosing from a pool
of available addresses) or statically (assigning a specific address to a device based
on its MAC address). This flexibility allows network administrators to ensure that

certain devices always receive the same IP address, which can be important for
printers, servers, or other network resources that need to have a consistent address.

Large networks often use multiple DHCP servers to ensure reliability and load
balancing. If one server fails, another
can take over, providing continuous
network configuration services to client devices. This redundancy is crucial for
maintaining network connectivity and performance.

File server
A file server is a dedicated server used to store and manage data files and
directories in a netwarked environment, allowing multiple users and devices to
access and share files. This central repository for storing documents, images,
videos, and other data types facilitates collaboration and data sharing among
network users while maintaining centralized data management and security.
When a user or a device needs to access a file stored on the file server, they send
a request over the network to the server. The file server, upon authenticating
the user's access rights, grants or denies access to the requested file or folder. If
access is granted, the user can then read, edit, or save changes to the file directly
on the server, depending on their permissions. This centralized access control
helps in managing and protecting the data more effectively.

129

A2 Networks

File servers are configured with large storage capacities and robust file
management software to handle simultaneous access requests from multiple
users. This setup ensures that files are available whenever needed and can
be efficiently located and retrieved. For example, a file server might host a
company’s shared documents, making the documents accessible toc employees
from their computers or mobile devices without the need to physically transfer
files using external storage devices.
To enhance performance and reliability, file servers often employ redundancy
and backup solutions, such as redundant array of independent disks (RAID)
configurations and regular backup schedules. This ensures data integrity and
availability even in the event of hardware failures or data corruption.
File servers can be optimized for different scales of operations, from small office
environments to large enterprises, by adjusting storage capacities, network
configurations and access protocols (such as SMB for Windows environments
and NFS for Unix/Linux environments). The choice offile server setup and
configuration depends on the organization’s size, the volume of data handled,
and specific security, performance and accessibility requirements.

Mail server
A mail serveris a specialized server that handles the sending, receiving and
storing of email for users within a network. It acts as a digital post office,
facilitating communication between users by transferring email messages from
one account to another over the internet or within an organization’s internal
network. Mail servers can take the role of mail delivery agent (MDA) or mail
transfer agent (MTA) or both.
Mail servers operate based on standardized email protocols such as simple mail
transfer protocol (SMTP) for sending emails, post office protocol version 3 (POP3)
or internet message access protocol (IMAP) for receiving emails. A mail server
ensures that emails reach their intended recipients and that users can retrieve
their emails from the server.
When a user sends an email, the email client on their device connects to

the SMTP server. The SMTP component of the mail server processes the
outgoing email, determining where to send the message based on the
recipient’s email address, and then forwards the email to the recipient’s mail
server. If the recipient is within the same mail server, the email is directly routed
to the appropriate mailbox.
For incoming emails, the mail server uses either POP3 or IMAP. POP3 allows
email clients to download emails from the server to the client’s device and then
typically deletes the email from the server. In contrast, IMAP synchronizes the
email among multiple devices while keeping the emails stored on the server,
allowing users to access their mail from any device with internet access.
Mail servers are equipped with various security measures, such as spam
filters and antivirus programs, to protect users from malicious emails and to
manage unwanted spam emails effectively. These measures help to ensure
that only legitimate emails reach user inboxes. In more recent times, domain
keys identified mail (DKIM), sender policy framework (SPF) and domain-based
message authentication, reporting and conformance (DMARC) policies are
required for email to be accepted without being flagged as spam.

130

A2.2 Network architecture

Proxy server
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a user’s device and the internet,
providing various functionalities such as enhancing security, improving performance,
and ensuring privacy. When a user requestsa web page or any online resource,
the request is sent to the proxy server first. The proxy server then evaluates the
request according to its filtering rules—which may involve content filtering, user
authentication, or another policy enforcement—before sending the request to the
internet. Upon retrieving the requested resource, the proxy server relays it back to
the user, optionally caching the content for faster access in future requests.
Client

Proxy

Web

SErver

A Figure 19 A simplified version of a proxy server

Proxy servers can perform several key roles:
*

By masking the user’s real IP address, a proxy server enhances privacy and
security. It can also prevent direct attacks on an internal network and enforce
access controls to sensitive websites or services.

*

Inan organizational or educational setting, proxy servers are used to block
access to specific websites according to content policies, such as sites that
are not safe for work or do not comply with institutional guidelines.

*

Proxy servers can store copies of frequently accessed web resources. This
reduces bandwidth usage, speeds up access for users, and reduces latency,
since the information can be served from the proxy server’s local cache
instead of retrieving it from the original source each time.

*

They can monitor and log all web requests, allowing organizations to keep
track of internet usage and detect potentially harmful or unauthorized activity.

For example, a company may employ a proxy server to control and monitor
its employees’ internet access. When an employee accesses the internet,
their request goes to the proxy server, which checks the request against the
company’s internet usage policies. If the request is for a website that is not
blocked, the proxy retrieves the content, returns it to the employee’s browser,
and logs the activity for future review. If the website is blocked, the proxy will
deny the request, possibly returning a message explaining the restriction.
Additionally, public proxy servers provide a means for users to conceal their
IP addresses and geographical location, offering a degree of anonymity when
browsing the internet. This is particularly useful for accessing geo-restricted
content or for users in countries with strict internet censorship policies.

Web server
Aweb server is a software and hardware combination that stores, processes and
delivers web pages to clients upon request. When a user enters a URL in their browser
or clicks a link, the browser sends a request to the web server hosting the site. The
server then processes this request and sends back the requested web page, typically
using HTTP protocol, which the browser then renders for the user to view.

131

A2 Networks

Web servers operate using HTTP and its secure version, HTTPS, which define
how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web browsers

and servers should take in response to various commands.
Common web servers include Apache, Nginx and [IS.
How web servers work
1.

Web servers host the files that make up websites, including HTML files,

style sheets (CSS), JavaScript files and multimedia content. This content
is stored in a manner that makes it easily retrievable and deliverable
upon request.
2.

When a web server receives an HTTP request from a client (such as a web
browser), it interprets the request, locates the requested files, and returns

them to the client. If the requested content involves dynamic pages, the
server may need to execute server-side scripts (for example, PHP, Python or
Node
js) to generate the content before sending it.
3.

Theserver delivers the requested content back to the client over the internet,
ensuring that the content is formatted and encoded in a way that the client’s
browser can interpret and display.

4.

Web servers implement security measures, including SSL/TLS encryption
for HTTPS, to ensure secure data transmission. They also manage access
controls and authentication to protect sensitive content.

A web server example
Imagine a small business, “Bekka’s Bakery”, has a website to showcase its
products and allow customers to place orders online. The website is hosted on
a web server. When a customer wants to view the bakery's menu, they enter the
website’s URL into their browser.

132

*

The browser sends a request to the web server hosting the “Bekka’s Bakery”
website.

*

The web server receives the request and locates the specific HTML file for the
menu page.

*

Ifthe menu page content is static, the server immediately sends this HTML
file back to the browser. If the content is dynamic, the server might first run
some server-side scripts to fetch the latest menu items from a database.

*

The server then sends the generated HTML content aver the internet to the
customer's browser, encrypted with HTTPS if supported.

*

The customer’s browser receives the HTML file and renders the menu page
for the customer
to view.

A2.2.3 Compare and contrast
networking models
Client-server model
In the client-server model, a server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the

resources and services, which are requested by the client. The client-server
model is characterized by request/response, where the client requests and the
server responds. This model is centralized, with servers acting as the centralized
points of access.

Security

Centralized security measures can be more
straightforward to administer, offering potentially
better protection against unauthorised access.

Centralized servers are lucrative targets for
cyberattacks, which can compromise data integrity
and availability.

Efficiency | Servers can be optimized for specific tasks,
improving the efficiency of data processing and
resource allocation.

High client demand can overload servers, leading to
bottlenecks and reduced performance.

Reliability | With professional maintenance and robust
infrastructure, servers can offer high reliability and
uptime for clients.

The server is a single point of failure. If the server
goes down, the services become unavailable to
all clients.

Real-world applications
Accessing a website using a browser (client) that requests data from a server
hosting the website (server) is a real-world application of the client-server model.
The benefits might be centralized management and updating of website content.
Enhanced security measures can be centrally applied, and you do not need to
waorry about multiple versions of software. However, if the server goes down, the
website becomes inaccessible. Scalability might require significant resources for
traffic management.

Using an email client such as Microsoft Outlook to send and receive messages
through a central server such as Microsoft Exchange offers benefits such as
centralized control over security protocols and data storage, and easier backup
and archiving. However, a single point of failure can compromise access
for all users, and there are potentially higher costs for server maintenance
and scalability.
A common task is accessing your bank account through a
banking app or website where transactions are processed on
central servers. This method of access allows for enhanced
security protocols, and centralized transaction processing
ensures consistency and reliability. Of course, a bank might be a
tempting target for cyberattacks, and any downtime would affect
all users simultaneously.

Real-world applications
Using BitTorrent is a method to download or upload files where files are shared
directly between users’ computers without a central server. A major benefit is that
it reduces the need for powerful central servers, and it can be faster for sharing
large files, as multiple peers can transfer data segments simultaneously. Because
it is a P2P model, there is less control over data security and the speed of the
network is dependent on the number of peers (availability may vary).
Skype uses a P2P model for establishing direct connections between users for
voice calls. Benefits include scalability, as the system can handle more users
without needing much infrastructure investment, and potentially better call
quality due to direct routing. Drawbacks include reliability, which can be an issue
if peers have unstable connections. As with any P2P model, there are challenges
in implementing centralized data policies and security measures.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, operating on a
P2P network where each node holds a copy of the transaction ledger. Benefits
include decentralization, which enhances security and reduces the risk of fraud,

and there is no single point of failure. Drawbacks include significant energy
consumption for consensus mechanisms in some blockchains, and transactions
can be slower compared to centralized models.

A2.2.4 Explain the concepts and
applications of network segmentation
Network segmentation refers to the division of a computer network into
smaller, distinct segments or subnetworks. This approach serves several
purposes, primarily enhancing performance and security. By breaking down a
larger network into manageable parts, network segmentation allows for more
controlled access, reduced congestion, and tailored security policies.

A2.2 Network architecture

Network segmentation strategically divides a computer network into smaller,
distinct parts or subnetworks. Security is improved on segmented networks
because only allowed traffic can access network resources within the same
segment. Network traffic cannot cross different segments. For example, if you
worked in a bank, you would want to separate the wireless network for guests
from the network with customer accounts. A device within the guest segment
could not cross into the customer account segment.
Segmentation also introduces better performance in networks. For example,
if your home network has two teenage users, each of whom have 37 different
games, videos and music streams playing at the same time, your network is
going to be congested, with poor performance for everyone (including the
parents, who might want to watch a video). But if we segment this network
and createa “teenage” segment and a “parent” segment, then the heavy
teenage traffic will be isolated from the parent traffic. Segmentation confines
network traffic to specific logical areas, reducing the load on the network’s
overall infrastructure.
Dividing a network into segments reduces congestion by distributing traffic
more evenly across the network. This distribution helps avoid overloading
any single pathway, ensuring a smoother flow of data. Network administrators
can identify and upgrade segments experiencing high traffic volumes without
overhauling the entire network, leading to cost-effective performance
enhancements. For example, ifa network was not segmented and 50 students
were all streaming high definition video at the same time, they could negatively
impact the entire network. However, if those students were on a segmented
network, they would not impact other segments of the network (but their
segment might be very slow).
Segmentation allows for more manageable network growth. New segments
can be added as needed without disrupting existing configurations, thus
facilitating scalable and controlled expansion. Administrators can monitor
and manage traffic more effectively within segments. This improved oversight
enables quicker identification and resolution of issues, optimizing network health
and performance.
In general, you should think about segmentation as if you are isolating parts of
the same network. Segmentation is a very powerful tool for performance and
security, reducing congestion and efficiently managing network resources.

Methods of network segmentation
Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, distinct
segments. This division can be achieved through various methods, including
subnetting and the use of virtual local area networks (VLANSs).

Subnetting
Subnetting is a technique used to divide a larger IP network into smaller, logically
segmented networks called subnets. This process involves manipulating the
subnet mask, which dictates how the IP address space is divided.

Devices with the same network portion (as determined by the subnet mask)

directly. Devices with different network portions need a router to facilitate
communication.

To identify the network address, you perform a bitwise AND operation between
the IP address and the subnet mask.

would need to use a router in order to reach device A.

The device is identified by its IP address. The subnet mask 255.255.255.0

Access control list (ACL) A set of
rules that specifies which users or
system processes are granted access

to objects, as well as what operations
are allowed on given objects.

You will learn more about IP

addressing in the next section.

Subnetting improves routing efficiency by reducing the size of routing tables, as
routers only need to store routes to subnets rather than individual IP addresses.
It allows for better management of IP address space, enabling organizations to
allocate IP addresses more efficiently across different departments or geographic
locations. Subnets can be used to isolate network segments, limiting broadcast
traffic and improving security by controlling access between subnets through

routing rules and access control lists (ACLs).
An ACL is a set of rules that specifies which users or system processes are granted
access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each
entry in an ACL specifies a subject and an operation.
Objects: These are resources such as files, directories or devices that require
access control.
Subjects: These are typically users, groups or system processes that are
attempting to access a resource.
Operations: These refer to actions such as read, write, execute or delete that the

subject can perform on the object.

Virtual local area networks (VLANS)
VLANSs enable the segmentation ofa physical network into multiple logical
networks. VLANSs allow devices to be grouped together, even if they are not
connected to the same network switch, and manage network traffic in a way that
is independent of their physical location.
VLANSs offer the flexibility to group devices according to functional,
departmental, or application-specific needs rather than their physical location,
enhancing network efficiency and security. By segmenting network trafficinto
VLANS, sensitive data can be kept separate from other network traffic, reducing
the risk of data breaches. Inter-VLAN routing rules can further enhance security
by controlling which VLANs can communicate with each other. VLANS limit
broadcast domains, reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic on the network.
This containment improves network performance by ensuring that broadcast
trafficis only sent where it is needed.
Subnetting and VLANSs often work together within network segmentation to
optimise both the logical and physical aspects of the network.
VLANSs allow for logical separation without the need for physical separation
of devices. Subnetting can be used in conjunction with VLANs to map logical
segments to specific IP address ranges, enhancing the organization and
management of network resources.
By combining subnetting and VLANSs, netwaorks can achieve a high level of
security and performance optimization. VLANs segment the network, while
subnetting provides an additional layer of segmentation.

A2.2 Network architecture

A small company with 20 employees has a single switch connecting
all devices, including computers, printers and servers. The company
wants to segregate the network into two distinct sections, one for the
accounting department and one for the sales department, to enhance
security and reduce unnecessary network traffic between the two
departments. The company has one switch and does not want to buy
additional hardware.
The accounting department has 10 employees, and the sales department
has 10 employees. The switch has 24 ports.
The network administrator
assigns ports 1-10 to VLAN
10 (Accounting) and ports
11-20 to VLAN 20 (Sales).
The remaining ports can be
used for shared resources or
further expansion. Accounting
A Rgure23 A 24-port switch
department devices are
connected to ports 1-10 on the switch. Sales department devices are
connected to ports 11-20.
An accounting department computer is plugged into port 3 on the
switch, making it part of VLAN 10. A sales department computer
is plugged into port 15, making it part of VLAN 20. The result is
network segregation, where computers in VLAN 10 (Accounting) can
communicate with each other but not with devices in VLAN 20 (Sales),

and vice versa. This segregation reduces unnecessary broadcast traffic
and enhances security. The network administrator can apply policies—
such as security or QoS (quality of service}—differently to each VLAN,
according to the needs of each department.

Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation
CIDR notation is a method for specifying IP addresses and their associated routing
prefix. It replaces the older system based on classes A, B and C. CIDR notation
provides a compact and flexible way to define IP networks and their sizes.
The key points of CDR notation are as follows.
Format: CIDR notation combines an IP address with a suffix indicating
the number of bits in the subnet mask. For example, in CIDR notation
192.168.1.0/24,192.168.1.0is the IP address, and /24 indicates that the first 24

bits are the network portion.
Subnet Mask: The number after the slash (/) represents the number of bits

setto 1in the subnet mask. For example, /24 corresponds to a subnet mask of
255.255.255.0. In binary, this is TTTTT111.11111111.11111111.00000000.
Flexibility: CIDR notation allows more efficient allocation of IP addresses by
supporting variable-length subnet masking (VLSM). It enables more granular
control over network sizes, avoiding wasteful allocation of IP address ranges.

A2.3.1 Describe different types

of IP addressing
The internet protocol (IP)
The internet protocol (IP) facilitates the routing and delivery of packets across
various networks. Central to the internet protocol is an IP address. An IP address
is a unique numerical address assigned to each device connected to a computer
network that uses the internet protocol for communication.

The distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
There are two types of IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is a 32-bit addressing
scheme, resulting in about 4.3 billion possible unique addresses. Addresses are
represented with dotted decimal format, for example, 192.168.1.1. An address
segment cannot be lower than O nor higher than 255. Many IPv4 addresses are
reserved for special purposes (these will be discussed later in this section).
IPv6 is a 128-bit addressing scheme, resulting in approximately 340 undecillion
(3.4 x 10°®8) possible unique addresses. IPv6 addresses are represented as eight
groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (for example, 2001:0db8
:85a3:0000:0000:8a2¢e:0370:7334). Many IPv6 addresses are also reserved for
special purposes.

The differences between public IP addresses and private
IP addresses
Public IP addresses
Public IP addresses are assigned to devices that directly access the internet.
These addresses are unique across the entire internet, meaning no two devices
can have the same public IP address simultaneously. Managed and allocated
by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and distributed through
regional internet registries to ensure uniqueness, public IP addresses are used by
servers hosting websites, email servers, and any device that needs to be directly
accessible from the internet. Devices with a public IP address can be accessed
from anywhere on the internet, assuming the appropriate network and security
configurations allow it.
Private IP addresses
Private IP addresses are used within a private network and are not directly
exposed to the internet. These addresses allow multiple devices to communicate
within the same network. They are defined by RFC 1918, which specifies specific
IP address ranges for private use. These ranges are not routed on the internet,
making them reusable by anyone in private networks.
Private addresses are commonly used in home networks, office networks and
other LAN setups for devices such as computers, printers and smartphones.
Devices with a private IP address cannot be accessed directly from the internet
without a form of network address translation (NAT), which we will discuss later
in this section.
Table 7 Common private IP address ranges
Private address range

Description

From 10.0.0.0t0 10.255.255.255

This range allows for a single large
private network with 16,777,216

possible addresses (24-bit block).
An example of a private IP address in
this range could be 10.1.2.3.
From 172.16.0.0t0 172.31.255.255 | This range is suitable for multiple
mid-sized private networks, offering
1,048,5/6 possible addresses across

16 contiguous 20-bit blocks. An
example from this range is 172.16.0.1.
From 192.168.0.0to
192.168.255.255

This range is often used for smaller
private networks, such as home Wi-Fi
networks. It offers 65,536 possible

addresses across 256 contiguous
16-bit blocks. A common example from
this range is 192.168.1.1, frequently
used as a default gateway address in
home routers.

145

A2 Networks

A special note about 127.0.0.1
The IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 is known as the loopback address in IPv4 networking.
It is a special address that is used by a computer to direct network traffic back to
itself. The entire range 127.0.0.0 t0 127.255.255.255 is reserved for loopback
purposes, but 127.0.0.1 is the most commonly used address in this range.
IPv6 uses 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 for this purpose.
IPv6 has a convenient shorthand notation for this address, ::1, where the double

colon (::) represents a string of consecutive zeros. This shortened notation is the
standard and preferred way of representing the IPv6 loopback address.

The differences between static IP addresses and dynamic
IP addresses
Static IP addresses
A static IP address is permanently assigned to a device or server. Once a device is
assigned a static IP address, the address does not change. Static addresses must be
manually configured and managed, often by a network administrator or by the user,
depending on the network's setup. Can you imagine how much work this would
be if there were thousands of users in your organization? Static IP addresses are
ideal for devices that need to maintain the same |IP address, such as web servers,

email servers, and other devices that require stable addressing. The advantages
of static addressing include ensuring reliable and consistent communication for
services that need to be continuously available and accessible.

Dynamic IP addresses
Dynamic IP addresses are assigned to devices on a temporary basis. Each
time the device connects to the network, it may be assigned a new IP address.
Dynamic IP addresses are allocated by a DHCP server, which assigns IP addresses
from a pool of available addresses. Dynamic addresses efficiently manage
the limited pool of IP addresses by reassigning addresses to different devices
as needed.

The role of network address translation (NAT)
There are not enough IPv4 addresses to assign every device a unique address.
How would you solve this problem? We have an alternative in IPvG, but IPv6
sometimes requires new network hardware and has been slow to be adopted.
Network address translation (NAT) enables private IP addresses to map to a single
public IP address (or a few addresses), drastically reducing the number of public
IP addresses required for each device on the internet.

A2.3 Data transmissions

When a device within the private network initiates a connection to the internet,
the NAT device (typically a router) replaces the device's private IP address in
the packet header with the router’s public IP address before sending it to the
internet. It also modifies the source port number so that replies can be accurately
directed back to the originating device.
For incoming traffic, the NAT device translates the public IP address and port
number back to the corresponding private IP address and port number based on
an internal NAT table that tracks active sessions. This ensures that responses from
the internet reach the correct device on the private network.
You might have thousands of devices within a private network, but thanks to NAT
they would all seem to be coming from a single IP address. This is a powerful tool
in minimizing the number of public IP addresses used.

A2.3.2 Compare types of media for data
transmission
Wired (fibre-optic and twisted pair) and wireless
Fibre-optic cables use pulses of light to transmit data at very high speeds over
considerable distances. These cables contain glass or plastic fibres which
transmit light.
Twisted pair cables use pulses of electricity to transmit data. They consist of
pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together. Twisted pair cables are divided
into two categories: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair
(STP). UTP is the most commonly-used cable in computer networking. STP
includes additional shielding to further reduce interference, making it suitable for
environments with high electromagnetic interference.

Wireless technology uses electromagnetic waves, such as radio frequencies,
infrared and microwaves, to send signals. Common wireless technologies
include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks.
Factors to consider with data transmission include bandwidth, installation

All of these factors can vary widely depending on specific conditions, technology
standards, and deployment scenarios. Moreover, actual user experiences may
vary significantly from these peak theoretical speeds due to factors like network
congestion, distance from the access point or cell tower, physical obstructions,
and the specific configurations of the netwaork.
Selecting the appropriate media type for data transmission in a network requires
careful consideration ofvarious factors. These factors influence the network’s
performance, cost and overall effectiveness in meeting the demands of its users.

A2.3.3 Explain how packet switching is
used to send data across a network
How exactly are messages passed from your device to another device on
another network?
Packet switching is a method used to send data across a network by breaking
data into small segments known as packets. How those packets are routed is the
main focus of this section.

A Figure 28 Which route should a packet take to efficiently arrive at its destination?

Data segmentation
As data is sent to a destination, the data is changed into a packet (or many
packets, depending on the size of the data being sent). This process is known as
encapsulation. Encapsulation is the process of adding or wrapping data with
necessary protocol information before it is transmitted over the network.
When data is received by the destination, the data is rebuilt into the original
request. This process is known as decapsulation. Decapsulation is the process
of removing protocol information that was added to the data before it was
transmitted over the network.
An example of the process of data segmentation into packets
Imagine you are playing a multiplayer game of Minecraft with a friend online,
and you are building a structure together. Here is how packet switching works in
this scenario.
1. Action initiation
You decide to place a block of stone in your Minecraft world. This action needs to
be communicated to the game server so that your friend, who is also connected
to the same server, sees the block appear in the game.

A Figure 29 A character from
the popular game Minecraft

(online multiplayer mode)
walking forward

A2 Networks

2. Data segmentation
The action of placing a stone block is converted into data. This data includes
information about the type of block (stone), the coordinates where it should be
placed, and the player who is placing it. Instead of sending all this data in one big
chunk, the game breaks it down into smaller pieces, known as packets.
3. Packet creation (encapsulation)
Each packet contains a portion of the data related to your action. For example,
one packet might contain the coordinates of the block, while ancther packet
contains the block type (stone). Additionally, each packet is given a routing
header, which includes information like where the packet is coming from (your
computer) and where it needs to go (the game server).

4. Adding control information (encapsulation)
The packets also contain control information to ensure they are delivered
correctly. This might include sequence numbers so the server knows in what
order
to reassemble the packets, and error-checking codes to detect if any
packets have been damaged during transmission.
5. Independent transmission
These packets are now sent from your computer to the game server. However,
instead of travelling together as a single large piece of data, they are sent
independently. Each packet can take a different route through the internet
depending on the current network conditions.
6. Routing
As the packets travel through the network, routers along the way decide the
best path for each packet based on network traffic and availability. For example,
one packet might travel through a server in New York, while another might go
through a server in Chicago. The routing decision is made dynamically for each
packet.
7. Arrival at the server

Eventually, all the packets arrive at the game server. Since they might have taken
different routes, they may arrive out of order or at slightly different times.

8. Reassembly at the server (decapsulation)
The game server uses the sequence numbers in the headers to reassemble the
packets into the complete action that you originally performed (placing the stone
block at specific coordinates). If any packets are missing or damaged, the server
can request that those specific packets be resent.
9. Updating the game world
Once the server has reassembled the action, it updates the game world to reflect
the stone block being placed. This update is then communicated to your friend’s
computer in a similar packet-switched manner, so they see the block appearin
the game at the same location.
10. Final display
Your friend’s game reassembles the packets it receives from the server, and the
stone block appears in their game exactly where you placed it, ensuring that both
of you see the same world and can continue building together seamlessly.

150

A2.3 Data transmissions

Bringing it all together
Remember:

*

datais segmented into packets; each packet includes payload (the
actual data) and header information, which contains metadata such as

the destination address, source address, sequence information and error
detection codes

*

once all the packets arrive at their destination, they are reassembled in the
correct order to reconstruct the original message; this process relies on
sequence numbers included in each packet's header.

Packet-switched networks send each packet independently. Packets may travel
through different paths to reach the same destination, depending on network
congestion, link failures and routing decisions. Packets are routed based on the
network conditions and the routing table information available at each node
(router). A routing table is a data file in routers that contains rules to determine the

best possible path for forwarding a data packet to its destination.
This flexibility allows the network to adapt to changes, such as traffic load,
ensuring optimal use of resources and maintaining data flow even if some parts of
the network fail. When you draw a picture of the internet, you might draw itas a
cloud because you cannot definitively know what path a packet will take.

The role of switches and routers
Switches manage how data packets are moved within a local network segment or
a LAN. Switches forward data packets based on MAC addresses. They maintain a
MAC address table to efficiently route packets to their correct destination within
the LAN. By doing so, switches contribute to reducing network congestion and
ensuring that packets reach their intended devices directly.

A Figure 30 A 36-port switch

Routers are responsible for forwarding data packets based on IP addresses.
They analyse the destination IP address contained in the packet’s header,
consult their routing table to determine the packet’s next hop, and route
the packet towards its destination across multiple networks. Routers enable
communication between disparate networks, making them essential for the
global interconnectivity of the internet. They assess multiple paths for packet
transmission, choosing the most efficient route based on current network
conditions, which may include considerations of speed, distance, traffic
congestion, or other metrics.

151

A2 Networks

A2.3.4 Explain how static routing and
dynamic routing move data across local
area networks
Static routing involves manually configuring routers with specific routes to
network destinations. This process requires network administrators to explicitly
define paths between devices across a LAN and beyond.
Dynamic routing enables routers to automatically discover and maintain routes to
network destinations. Routers communicate using routing protocols to exchange
information about network topology changes. This process allows network paths
to be adjusted dynamically, based on current network conditions.

Static routing
Static routing involves a network administrator entering routing information
directly into the router’s configuration. This information includes the destination
network address, subnet mask, and the next hop address or exit interface.

Each router maintains a routing table that contains the statically configured
routes along with any directly connected networks. This table is used to make
forwarding decisions for incoming packets. When a packet arrives at a router, the
router examines the packet’s destination IP address and searches its routing table
fora matching route. Ifa matching static route is found, the router forwards the
packet to the specified next hop or exits the interface. If no match is found, the
packet is dropped or sento a default route if configured.
Static routing is ideal for small networks where routes do not change frequently.
Routes are predefined, making network behaviour more predictable.
Static routes do not require additional processing power or bandwidth to
communicate route information, as there is no need for routers to exchange route
information dynamically. Finally, by controlling exactly which routes are valid, an
administrator can improve the network’s security.
Static routing is not without disadvantages. These include the manual effort to
maintain routing tables as a network grows. Static routes do not adapt to network
changes, such as link failures, which can lead to increased downtime. In larger
networks, configuring static routes becomes complex and error-prone.

Dynamic routing
Dynamic routing involves routing protocols (for example, RIP, OSPF, BGP) which

define how routers communicate and exchange information. Routing protocols
enable routers to discover network destinations and maintain up-to-date routing
information. Routers send and receive routing updates to learn about the
existence of each other and network destinations and importantly, the time to
access neighbouring routers. Routing protocols use algorithms to determine the
best path for packet forwarding based on various metrics (for example, hop count,
bandwidth, latency). When there is a network change (for example, a link failure),
the routing protocol automatically recalculates paths and updates the routing
tables accordingly.
One of the main advantages of dynamic routing is routers can quickly adapt to
changes in the network, such as link failures or additions by finding new paths.
In addition, itis easier
to manage in large and growing networks because routes

152

A2.3 Data transmissions

are updated automatically. Once dynamic routing protocols are configured,
the network can adjust to changes without manual intervention. Many dynamic
routing protocols are capable of selecting the most efficient route based on
various metrics, enhancing network performance.
Among the disadvantages, configuring and maintaining dynamic routing
protocols can be more complex than static routing. Dynamic routing requires
processing power and bandwidth for routers to exchange route information.
The time it takes for all routers to learn about network changes and reach a state
of consistent knowledge can affect network performance (this time is called
convergence). The exchange of routing information can introduce security
risks if not properly secured.

A2.4.1 Discuss the effectiveness of firewalls

at protecting a network
A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and filters
incoming and outgoing network traffic at the packet level. Firewalls inspect
packet headers to filter traffic based on IP addresses and ports. Modern firewalls
(also known as next-generation firewalls or layer 7 firewalls) can inspect the
content of packets (not just the headers) and filter traffic.
Firewalls inspect each packet of data which attempts to enter or exit a network,
making decisions about each packet based on predetermined criteria.
A whitelist is a list of approved entities, such as IP addresses, domain names or
applications, which are allowed to communicate with the network. Traffic which
matches a whitelist entry is automatically permitted, ensuring that known safe
sources or necessary business applications have unimpeded access.
A blacklist contains identifiers such as IP addresses, domain names or

applications which are not approved. Blacklists block network traffic deemed
harmful or unnecessary for business operations, helping to prevent attacks from
known malicious sources.
Firewalls are configured with a set of rules which specify which types of traffic
are allowed or blocked based on attributes such as source and destination
IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols (TCP/UDP). These rules are

prioritized and processed in sequence. The firewall examines each packet
against these rules until a match is found, at which point the corresponding
action (allow or block) is taken.

TOK
The term firewall originally referred to physical walls within buildings designed
to prevent the spread of fire. Over time, it came to be used to refer to network
security systems too.

How can using figurative language help in the acquisition of knowledge?

Strengths and limitations of firewalls
Table 10 Strengths offirewalls
Access control

Firewalls control access to network resources. By filtering incoming and outgoing
traffic based on IP addresses, domain names, ports and protocols, they ensure
that only authorized traffic can access the network, significantly reducing the risk of
unauthorized access.

Traffic monitoring and logging | Firewalls monitor all network traffic, allowing for detailed logging and real-time alerts on
suspicious activities. This capability is vital for identifying and responding to potential
threats promptly.
Versatility and scalability

Modern firewalls are highly versatile, offering capabilities beyond simple packet filtering,
such as VPN support, intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and deep packet inspection
(DPI). They can be scaled to accommodate the growing network demands of an
organization.

Application-level security

Application layer (or next-generation) firewalls can inspect the content of the data
packets, providing security measures for specific applications. This allows for more
granular control and protection against application-level attacks.

Table 11 Limitations offirewalls

Internal threats

Firewalls are less effective against threats that originate from within the network, such as from
a malicious insider. Since firewalls primarily control ingress and egress traffic, their ability to
mitigate internal risks is limited.

Sophisticated attacks

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and some forms of malware can bypass firewall
protections through encrypted traffic, zero-day vulnerabilities, or by masquerading as
legitimate traffic, making it challenging for firewalls to detect and block such threats.

management complexity | Misconfigured firewalls can introduce security vulnerabilities or block legitimate traffic,
hindering network operations.
Performance impact

Inspecting and filtering traffic can introduce latency, especially if deep packet inspection or
other resource-intensive processes are involved. This can impact the performance of critical
applications and services.

Network address translation (NAT) to enhance network
security
NAT operates by modifying network address information in the IP header of
packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. From a security
perspective, NAT provides several benefits.

Review section A2.3.1, which

discusses NAT in depth.

One of the most notable security features of NAT is IP masquerading, where
multiple devices on a private network use one public IP address for all external
communications. This hides individual IP addresses of devices on the internal
network from the external world, making it more difficult for attackers to directly
target internal network devices.
By controlling which internal addresses are translated and allowed to
communicate with the external network, NAT serves as a rudimentary form of
access control. This can help prevent unauthorized access to certain parts of the
network or restrict internet access to specific devices.

Vulnerability

Description and example

Distributed denial of | Aims to overwhelm a website or online service with excessive traffic from multiple sources,
service (DDoS)
rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.
Example: An e-commerce site is overwhelmed with traffic from thousands of infected
computers, causing it to crash during a major sales event.
Insecure network

Protocols that lack security measures, making them vulnerable to interception and exploitation.

protocols

Example: Using Telnet or FTP (insecure protocols) for remote server access allows potential
eavesdropping on credentials and data.

Malware

Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
Example: A ransomware attack encrypts files on the victim's computer, demanding payment
for decryption keys.

Man-in-the-middle

(MitM) attacks

The attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties
who believe they are directly communicating with each other.
Example: An attacker intercepts a Wi-Fi connection at a café to capture credit card information
sent during an online purchase.

Phishing attacks

Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit
card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.
Example: An email that appears to be from a bank asking recipients to confirm their account
details on a fake website.

SQLinjection

An attack that involves inserting malicious SQL statements into an input field for execution, to
manipulate or exploit SQL databases.
Example: Entering a specially crafted SQL command in a website’s search box that causes the
site to reveal sensitive user information.

Cross-site scripting
(XSS)

Avulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into content
viewed by other users.
Example: A comment on a blog that contains a script which, when viewed, steals cookies from
other users.

Unpatched software

Software that has not been updated with the latest security patches, making it vulnerable
to exploitation.
Example: An operating system that has not been updated, allowing attackers to exploit
known vulnerabilities.

Weak authentication

Security measures that are easy to bypass or crack, often due to simple or predictable
passwords, or lack of multifactor authentication.
Example: A website that only requires a username and a simple password, without requiring
any additional form of verification.

Zero-day exploits

Attacks that take advantage ofa previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware,
before the developer has released a patch or the public is aware of it.
Example: An attacker discovers a flaw in a popular browser and develops code to exploit it,
spreading malware before the issue is publicly known and patched.

156

A2.4 Network security

A2.4.3 Describe common network
countermeasures
Table 13 Common network countermeasures to mitigate network vulnerabilities
Policy

Description and example

Content security
policies (CSPs)

A browser-side mechanism that helps prevent malicious code injection attacks, such as cross-site
scripting (XSS). A CSP dictates from which domains and sources the browser can load scripts,
stylesheets, images or other resources.
Example: A website sets a CSP that only allows scripts to load from its own domain and a trusted
content delivery network (CDN). This blocks attempts to inject malicious scripts from unknown sources.

Complex password
policies

Rules enforcing the use of strong passwords (a mix of upper/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols,
minimum length) that are harder to crack. These policies often include password expiration and
preventing the reuse of recent passwords.
Example: A company requires employees to use passwords that are at least 12 characters long
and include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.

Encrypted protocols

Using protocols like HTTPS (the secure version of HTTP) that encrypt the communication between
web browsers and servers. This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks,
safeguarding sensitive data in transit.
Example: You visit an online store with “https://” in the address bar, indicating that your credit
card information will be encrypted during transmission.

Secure socket layer
(SSL) certificate /
transport layer
security (TLS)
certificate
Update software

Digital certificates installed on web servers to enable the use of HTTPS. They validate the server’s
identity to the client, ensuring you are connecting to the legitimate website.
Example: There is a padlock icon in your browser's address bar when visiting your bank’s website.
This signifies the presence of a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
Regular patching of operating systems, applications, and firmware fixes known vulnerabilities.
This reduces the “attack surface” that bad actors can exploit.
Example: Your operating system prompts you to install a critical security update that patches a
recently discovered vulnerability.

Distributed denial

of service (DDoS)
mitigation tools

Input validation
(filtering,
whitelisting)

Specialized services or software designed to detect and filter out massive amounts of malicious traffic
in a DDoS attack. They help ensure that legitimate users can still access websites and services.
Example: A large news website comes under a DDoS attack. Their mitigation tools detect the
surge in traffic, filter out malicious requests and maintain website availability for legitimate users.
Techniques used in web applications and software to ensure that user-submitted data is in the
correct format and does not contain malicious code. Filtering removes unwanted characters,
while whitelisting only allows specific, pre-approved characters or patterns.
Example: You try to create a username on a website with the code alert( XSS’ ). The input
validation blocks this attempt, preventing a potential cross-site scripting attack.

157

A2 Networks

E@Policy
Email filtering
solutions

Description and example
Detect and block spam, phishing emails, and malware that frequently comes through email
attachments. These solutions use advanced analysis to identify harmful patterns and known
malicious senders.
Example: An email filter blocks a phishing email disguised as an invoice from a familiar vendor
because it detects suspicious language and a mismatched sender address.

Intrusion detection
systems (IDS)

Network or host-based systems that monitor for suspicious activity or policy violations.
They raise alerts when they detect potential attacks, but do not directly block the traffic.
Example: An DS on a company network detects unusual port scanning activity likely aimed at
finding vulnerable systems.

Intrusion prevention
systems (IPS)

Similar to IDS, these systems have the capacity
to take proactive action to stop detected attacks,
such as blocking malicious traffic.
Example: An IPS notices four consecutive failed logins from the same IP address and blocks
the IP address from access.

Multi-factor

authentication (MFA)

A requirement for multiple forms of verification to access systems, reducing the risk of
unauthorized access.
Example: MFA might require a standard password plus a one-time password (OTP) so that users
must enter a password along with a time-sensitive one-time code. The OTP may be generated
by an app or sent via SMS. This increases the difficulty of compromising an account because it
requires more than just a password.

Virtual private
network (VPN)

Extends a private network across a public network, creating a secure and encrypted connection
between devices and the private network. This encryption ensures that data transmitted
over the VPN is protected from unauthorised access. Refer to section A2.1.1 for more detail.

Security testing and employee training
Regular security testing and employee training should not be seen as one-time
events. Continuous updates and reinforcement are important in a rapidly shifting
threat environment.
Tailored training is essential. Employees in different roles require specific training
relevant to their job functions and data access.
Regular security tests, such as penetration tests and vulnerability scans,
proactively search for weaknesses within your systems, software and networks.
These tests mimic real-world attack methods to uncover exploitable flaws before
cybercriminals do. The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing as new
attack techniques and vulnerabilities emerge. Frequent testing ensures you
remain updated on your security posture and can adapt defences as needed.
Security testing not only reveals issues but also validates that your
countermeasures (firewalls, IDS/IPS, and so on) are correctly configured and

working as intended. Many industries, such as finance and healthcare, have
regulations mandating regular security testing and audits. These tests provide
evidence of your organization’s commitment to security.
Employees are often the most vulnerable entry point for cyberattacks. Attackers
use social engineering, phishing emails and other tactics to trick employees
into giving up credentials or downloading malware. Effective training
transforms employees from potential liabilities into your first line of defence.

158

A2.4 Network security

They learn to recognize phishing attempts, handle sensitive data responsibly,
spot unusual activity, and follow security best practices. Regular training
reinforces security concepts and procedures, minimizing the risk of mistakes that
could lead to security breaches. A security-aware workforce understands threats
and actively reports suspicious activity to [T teams. They become partners in
maintaining a robust security posture.
Security testing results highlight areas where employees require more training.
For example, if 2 phishing test reveals a high rate of success, training can focus
on phishing awareness and email security. Security teams gain valuable data on
employee awareness from training quizzes and simulations. This data helps guide
the allocation of security resources and future training plans.
Training and testing, when combined, establish a clear understanding of security
expectations for employees. This encourages greater accountability and a shared
responsibility for data protection.

Wireless security measures
Wireless security goes beyond just securing your Wi-Fi network name and
password. While encryption (WPA2 or WPA3) is important, MAC filtering,
whitelists and blacklists add another layer of defence for your wireless network.
Every network interface card (NIC) on a device, such as a laptop or phone, has a
unique identifier called a MAC address. MAC filtering allows you to specify a list
of authorized MAC addresses that can connect to your Wi-Fi network. It prevents
unauthorized devices from connecting, even if they crack your Wi-Fi password.
MAC addresses can be spoofed (faked) by determined attackers. Newer devices
may have random MAC addresses for privacy reasons, requiring constant
updates to the filter list.
A whitelist is a list of approved MAC addresses that are explicitly allowed to
connect to your network. Any device not on the whitelist is denied access.
A blacklist, on the other hand, is a list of specific MAC addresses that are

explicitly denied access to your network, even if they know the password.
Whitelisting offers a more secure approach as unknown devices are automatically
blocked. Blacklists require knowing the MAC addresses of all authorized devices
beforehand, which can be cumbersome for a dynamic environment.
MAC filtering, whitelists and blacklists are most effective when combined with

strong WPA2/WPA3 encryption. Encryption scrambles the data transferred over
your Wi-Fi network, making it unreadable even if someone manages to connect.
A skilled attacker with the right tools might still be able to bypass them.

A2.4.4 Describe the process of encryption
and digital certificates
Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded form to prevent
unauthorized access. It involves using algorithms to transform plaintext into
ciphertext, a scrambled version of the original data that can only be read
if decrypted. Digital certificates, also known as public key certificates or
identity certificates, are electronic documents used to prove the ownership
ofa public key.

suitable for encrypting large volumes of data. However, the requirement for key
exchange over a secure channel can be challenging in terms of key management,
especially in systems with a large number of users.
Imagine Alice and Bob want to communicate securely. They decide to use
symmetric encryption with a shared secret key. Alice chooses a secret key and
securely shares it with Bob in person.
1.

Alice writes a message: “Meet me at noon.”

2.

She encrypts this message using the secret key and the symmetric encryption
algorithm, resulting in ciphertext (a scrambled message).

3.

Alice sends the ciphertext to Bob over an insecure channel (such as the
internet).

4.

Bob receives the ciphertext and uses the same secret key and algorithm to
decrypt it, recovering Alice's original message: “Meet me at noon.”

The same key used for encryption is also used for decryption, and it is important
that the key is shared securely between Alice and Bob. If a nefarious hacker had
the secret key, then the hacker could also read the message.
Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, involves a
pair of keys for each user: a public key and a private key. The public key is openly
distributed and can be used by anyone to encrypt data intended for the owner
of the pair. Conversely, the private key is kept secret by the owner and is used
to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key. Asymmetric
cryptography also enables digital signatures, where a user can sign data with
their private key, and others can verify the signature with the user’s public key.
This method solves the key distribution problem of symmetric cryptography, but
it is generally slower due to the computational complexity of the algorithms used.
Imagine that Alice wants to send Bob a secure message, and they decide to
use asymmetric encryption. Bob generates a pair of keys: a public key, which he
shares with Alice, and a private key, which he keeps secret.
1.

Alice writes a message: “Meet me at noon.”

2.

She encrypts her message using Bob's public key.

3.

Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.

4.

Upon receiving it, Bob uses his private key to decrypt the message, reading
Alice's original text: “Meet me at noon.”

The message is encrypted with Bob’s public key, which anyone can use to
encrypt messages for Bob. However, only Bob can decrypt the message with his
private key, ensuring the message'’s confidentiality. This method allows secure
communication without needing to share a secret key in advance.

The role of digital certificates
A digital certificate is an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind
a public key with an identity—information such as the name ofa person or an
organization, their address, and so on. The certificate can be used to verify that
a public key belongs to an individual, organization, or device. Digital certificates
are issued by trusted entities called certificate authorities (CAs), which verify the

certificate holder's identity before issuing the certificate.
Imagine Alice owns a website and wants to secure her site to protect her
users’ information. To do this, she needs to implement HTTPS on her website,

which requires a digital certificate. The underlying mechanism for this secure
communication is the TLS protocol, or its predecessor, SSL.
1.

Alice generates a key pair: a public key and a private key.

2.

Shethen submits a certificate signing request (CSR), which includes her

public key and website information, to a CA.
3.

The CA verifies Alice’s identity and the authenticity of her website. Upon
successful verification, the CA creates a digital certificate for Alice's website,

signing it with the CA’s private key.
4.

Alice installs this digital certificate on her web server.
Now, when a user visits Alice’s website, their browser checks the digital

certificate. Since the certificate is signed by a trusted CA, the browser
establishes a secure, encrypted connection using the public key in the
certificate. This process is largely invisible to the user but ensures that the
communication between the browser and Alice’s website is secure.
HTTPS is a very common place to encounter digital certificates in use, but there
are other use cases of digital certificates you should be aware of.

A2 Networks

SSH is commonly used for secure remote login and other secure network
services over an unsecured network. SSH traditionally uses password-based
authentication, but it can also be configured to use SSH keys (a form of digital
certificates) for authentication. In this setup, a user generates a pair of keys:
a private key kept secret and a public key placed on the server. Authentication is
performed by proving possession of the corresponding private key.
Digital certificates are also used for code signing, where developers sign their
software or code with a digital signature. This signature verifies the software’s
source and ensures that it has not been tampered with since it was signed.
When users download or run the signed software, their system checks the digital
signature using the public key in the certificate. If the signature is valid, it indicates
that the software is genuine and has not been altered.
VPN often use digital certificates for client and server authentication. In a typical
VPN setup using protocols such as IPsec or SSL/TLS, a server presents a digital
certificate to the client and, optionally, the client can also presenta certificate
to the server. This mutual authentication process ensures that both parties are
who they claim to be before establishing the encrypted VPN tunnel. Digital
certificates in VPNs enhance security by adding a layer of authentication on top of
encryption.

Digital certificates are also used for signing digital documents (PDFs, Word
documents, and so on) to verify the signer’s identity and ensure the document’s
integrity has not been compromised since it was signed. This application is
essential in legal, financial and official communications
where authenticity and
non-repudiation are critical.

The use of public and private keys in asymmetric

cryptography
In asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, two
different but mathematically related keys are used: a public key and a private key.
The public key is used to encrypt data. When someone wants to send a secure
message to the key owner, they encrypt the message using the recipient’s public
key. This ensures that only the recipient can decrypt the message, as only they
possess the corresponding private key.
Here is a short summary of how a public key is used to encrypt data.
1.

The sender must obtain the recipient’s public key. This can be done through
a public directory, a digital certificate, or directly from the recipient.

2.

Thesenderwrites the message they intend to send. If the message is lengthy or
requires additional security measures, it might first be compressed or hashed.

3.

Thesenderuses the recipient’s public key and an asymmetric encryption
algorithm to encrypt the message. Common algorithms include RSA, ECC
(elliptic curve cryptography), and ElGamal, each with its own method for
using the public key to encrypt data.

The private key is used to decrypt the data encrypted with the corresponding
public key. In the context of secure communications, when a message is received
which has been encrypted with the recipient’s public key, the recipient uses their
private key to decrypt it. This process ensures confidentiality, as only the intended
recipient can access the decrypted information.

162

A2.4 Network security

In digital signing, the private key is used to sign a document or a piece of data.
The signer generates a hash of the document and then encrypts this hash with
their private key, creating a digital signature. This signature is then attached to
the document.
To verifya digital signature, the recipient (or any party wishing to verify the
signature) uses the signer’s public key to decrypt the attached signature, thus
revealing the hash. The recipient then generates a new hash of the received
document and compares it to the decrypted hash. If they match, it confirms that
the document has not been altered since it was signed and that it was indeed
signed by the holder of the corresponding private key, thus verifying the integrity
and authenticity of the document.

@ Research skills
Hash functions are algorithms that take an input (or “message”) and return a
fixed-size string of bytes, typicallya digest that is unique to each unique input.
They are designed to be one-way functions, making it computationally infeasible
to reverse the process and derive the original input from the hash output. Hash
functions are widely used in cryptography for ensuring data integrity, generating
unique identifiers, and supporting secure password storage.
Imagine you have a message, “Hello, world!” and you apply a simple hash
function to it, such as MD5.

Input: “Hello, world!”
After applying the MD5 hash function, you get the output (digest).
Output: “fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677"
This output is a unique representation of the input message. If you slightly
alter the input, even just changing “Hello, world!” to “hello, world!”
(note the lowercase “h”), the hash output will be dramatically different,

demonstrating the sensitivity of hash functions to input changes.
Use web-based resources to find information about hash functions.
*

What are the advantages and disadvantages of MD57

*

Research at least one other hash function and compare it with MD5.
Explain when you would and would not use each function.

Encryption key management
An encryption key is a string of bits used by encryption algorithms to encrypt
data. This key dictates the output of the encryption process, and the same key

(in symmetric encryption) or a corresponding key (in asymmetric encryption) is
required to reverse the transformation, making the original data readable again.
If you have the key, you can open the lock.
Encryption key management refers to the processes and policies for handling,
storing and protecting encryption keys.
Proper key management ensures that encryption keys are only accessible to
authorized entities. Compromised keys can lead to unauthorized data access,
negating the benefits of encryption. By securely managing keys, organizations
can reduce the risk of data breaches. Even if data is intercepted, it remains
protected if the keys are secure. Many regulatory standards, such as GDPR,

163

A2 Networks

HIPAA and PCI DSS, mandate strict management and protection of encryption
keys as part of their data protection requirements. Non-compliance can result in
significant fines and legal consequences.
Effective key management ensures that keys are available when needed. Loss of
an encryption key can result in the loss of access to critical data, potentially
halting operations. Part of key management involves backing up keys securely,
ensuring they can be recovered in the event of accidental deletion or loss,
without compromising their security. As organizations grow and adopt new
technologies, their key management strategies need to scale accordingly.
Efficient key management solutions can adapt to increasing volumes of keys
and evolving cryptographic standards.

A3.1.1 Explain the features, benefits and
limitations of a relational database
A database is a systematically stored collection of data. The datais stored ina
logical manner, usually in several interconnected tables. You probably interact
with databases everyday without even being aware of it. Here are some examples
of databases that you may have had interactions with.
Retail management databases: If you use an online shop you are probably
going to be interacting with a database as they are used to keep track of the
products being sold, the customers buying the products, and the companies
supplying the products.
Social media: If you use social media you are interacting with elements of a
database. Your profile is part of the records they store about people, your posts
are stored in records, and interactions you make across the platform are stored.
Medical records database: Medical records are stored in databases, and any
interactions you have with a doctor or specialist are stored within a file, as well as
information about the staff
in the medical establishment and treatments they offer.
Data might be stored in a single entity (known as a flat file). The problem with
storing data in a flat file database is that data is often repeated throughout
the entity. This leads to data inconsistency because, if there are several similar
versions of the same data, it is challenging to know which is the correct data.
It also means that deleting data requires looking through masses of data in the
flat file, trying to ensure that all traces of the data are removed.

Entity A table within a database.

Another problem could be the volume of data being stored. In the flat file model,
lots of data is repeated, which uses up valuable storage space very quickly.
Therefore, databases are usually splitinto several entities that have links (known as
relationships) between them.
You almost certainly interact with a database on a regular basis.
One application of databases is to store information about users
in online games.
For example, if you play a massively multiplayer online role-playing
game (MMORPG) game, such as Lost Ark, a database will be used to
track your achievements, your transactions, your in-game chats, your
friend list and your inventory. When you save the game, your current
status is updated in the database, ready to reload when you rejoin
the game.

about a patient and an owner, meaning that a vet has to treat a patient before
being added to the database.
Deletion anomaly: You cannot delete data without all data in the record being
deleted. For example, if you delete all the information about a vet then you lose
all the information about the parent and owner.
Update anomaly: If an update is needed (such as a change of address) and you
do not change all records, then you will have different data in the database and
no longer know which is the correct version.

One of the biggest databases in the world is that of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States of

A Figure2 A relational database

Features of a relational database
Entity: The relational database now consists of four entities each containing data.
The patient entity stores information about the animal, the owner entity stores
the information about the owner of the animal or animals, and vet information

is stored in the vet entity. The final entity is the treatment entity, which stores
information about the treatment each patient received as well as the date of
the treatment.
Primary key: Primary keys are unique identifiers for an instance in an entity. For
example, there may be more than one dog called Oskar in the patient entity.
However, because of the primary key (the patient ID) we can tell which Oskar
we are referring to.

Normalization A process to
organize data in a database to
minimize the risk of anomalies.
Primary key A unique value for
each row in a database.
Foreign key A primary key value
that has been placed in another
entity to create a relationship.

Foreign key: A foreign key creates a relationship between the instances in the
entity so we can link information together. For example, you would like to know
the owner of each patient so you can update them on progress. To do this, the
primary key of the owner from the owner entity is placed in the patient entity. This
creates a link. The foreign key in the patient entity allows you to match the owner
using the primary key.

A Figure 3 Relationship between tables using a primary key as a foreign key

Composite key: Sometimes there are no unique values in a record, so you
have to link different values together
to make them unique. This can be seen in
the treatment entity. The patient ID cannot be used, as a patient may have many
treatments. However, if patient ID and date are used they become unique, as a
patient would not have more than one treatment in a day.

Attribute An attribute represents a
characteristic of the data.
Relationship The link between two
entities.
Cardinality The type of relationship
between two entities.

Concatenated key: Sometimes, when there are no unique values in a record,
data from the attributes can be placed together to create a unique key.
For example, in a table of people it may be a challenge to find a unique key.
If you take a substring ofa first name, surname, and date of birth you are more
likely to get a unique value. This is known as a concatenated key.
Relationships: There must be relationships between the entities otherwise the
data exists alone and is not very helpful.
Cardinality: Cardinality is the type of relationship between the entities. There are
three you need to be aware of.
*+

One-to-one: Aninstance in one entity can only be related to one instance in
another entity. In the example above, one patient can have one owner.

*

One-to-many: An instance in one entity can be related to many instances in
another entity. In the example above, one vet can perform many treatments.

*+

Many-to-many: Many instances in one entity can be related to many
instances in another entity. A real-life example could be that many students
are enrolled in many courses.

@ Research skills
Understanding how the data
relates to each other in a database
often requires research to
specify problems correctly and
decompose the problem.
Think about a database you
interact with regularly, such as an
online shop, a social media site,
or a school information system.
Identify the data that is stored and
investigate what the purpose of the
database is. Can you suggest some
entities that are being used?

170

Modality: Modality is the necessity of the relationship between entities. There
are two types of modality you need to be aware of.
*

Optional relationship: There may be a relationship, but there does not
have to be. For example, Actor (mandatory) and TV Show (optional). This
relationship is optional because actors do not have to be in TV shows. Some
actors are only on stage.

*

Mandatory relationship: There has to be a relationship between the two
entities. For example, Receipt (mandatory) and ltems (mandatory). This
relationship is mandatory because to have a receipt you have to have bought
at least one item.

Data retrieval: Using SQL commands, data retrieval is easier.
Reduced data duplication: Due to the use of entities and relationship, there is
less data duplication.
Reduced redundancy: As data is stored across entities using relationship links,
there is less redundant data.
Reliable transaction processing: Relational databases have several checks that
occur when transactions take place to ensure that the transactions are reliable.
Scalability: Relational databases are easier to scale than flat file databases.
Security: Relational databases have built-in security to support a multiuser
environment.

Limitations of a relational database
Big data scalability: Relational database models are not the best model for
storing data that will be mined to make complex decisions.
Design complexity: The different entities and models within the database can
be complex and challenging to implement.
Hierarchical data handling: The nature of the database model means trees are
stored in a hierarchical manner. This can lead to inefficient traversal of the tree,

especially if there are deep hierarchical layers.
Rigid schema: The schemas of the database are rigid data types, and
relationships must conform to very specific rules.
Object-relational impedance mismatch: Relational databases are useful for
storing data in dedicated databases. However, if the data then needs to be used
in an object-oriented space, for example, when dealing with big data, sometimes
the models might not be fully compatible.
Unstructured data handling: Unstructured data that does not follow the rigid
scheme of the database model can be difficult to place within the model.

A3.2.1 Describe database schema
A database schema is a blueprint of the database that identifies the different

entities (tables), attributes (fields) and relationships (links) within the database,
including the restraints on the data. The database schema is a model detailing
how the database has been set up, but the schema does not contain any actual
data. There are different models within the schema. These models describe the
database for different users of the system including users, administrators and
developers.
The three schemas that you need to be aware of in this course are the conceptual
schema, the logical schema and the physical schema.

The conceptual schema
This model of the database identifies all the entities within the database and the
relationship between these entities. This model does not contain specific details
such as the attributes within the entities nor information about the restraints on
the data, but does identify the types of relationships between the data. This level
of the database schema is viewed by both the users and the administrators/

ERD diagrams are similar to

(OOP), covered in section B3.1.2.
Just like in OOP, you need to have
a clear model identifying attributes
and behaviours that can be
understood by others.

The logical schema
This model of the database identifies the different attributes (the data that will be

stored about each item in the entity) within each ofthe entities. This will include
the primary keys and foreign keys which create the relationships between the
entities. This level of the schema will be used by both the programmer and the
administrator. However, this level will not be used by the user.
An example of the detail required in the logical schema is shown in Figure 7,
using the same database example as the example outlined in the conceptual
schema. The figure shows the information that will be stored about the Player, the
Team, and the Manager. The primary key is bold and the foreign key is denoted

The physical schema
This model of the databases identifies the different attributes and their data types
as well as the primary key and foreign key link that will create the relationships
between entities. The physical schema is a description of how the data will be
stored in the database, including specific files, indexes and storage structures.
This level of schema will be used by the programmer
as this is the schema used to
initially set up the database.
Continuing with the database examples from the conceptual and logical schema,
an example of the detail required in the physical schema is shown in Figure 8.

A3.2.2 Construct ERDs
Entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) show the entities (tables), attributes (fields),
and relationships within a relational database. There are different levels of ERDs
within the database schema. This section explains how to construct an ERD.

The different items within the ERD
Entity: An entity is an object that can have data stored about it. Entities are
usually named using a noun and are represented using a rectangle. Examples of
entities include: Student, Car, Player, Course, Product, Menu item.

Key: An entity needs to have at least one key (the different keys were outlined
in A3.1.1).
Relationships: The way in which the entities interact with each other is known
as the relationship. Relationships can be thought of
as the verbs that connect the
entities. For example, Student studies Course, Teacher teaches Course, Menu

contains Menu items.

175

A3 Databases

Look back at section Al.1.1 for more

information about relationships.

In some versions of the entity relationship diagrams, the relationship is identified in
adiamond. The type of relationship (known as the cardinality) can be one-to-one,
one-to-many or many-to-many. The relationship also needs to show the modality—
whether the entity is mandatory or not within the relationship. For example, actor
to theatre show is optional as many actors have not acted in theatre productions.
But menu to menu item is mandatory since a menu has to have a menu item.
Note that relationships are only read one way. A menu has menu items, buta
menu item does not belong to a menu unless you specify this.
Attributes: The attributes show the data that will be stored about each of the
items in the entity. For example, a car may have a make, model, engine size,
fuel type and registration number.
There are different representations of ERDs. All show the same data but are
represented differently. Three of the recognized conventions are shown in Figure 9.

A3.2 Database design

To construct an ERD, follow these steps.
Step 1: Identify the level of ERD required (conceptual, logical or physical). This
will determine the detail required.
Step 2: Identify the entities involved and, if required, the attributes and data types.
Step 3: Identify the relationships (using verbs) between the entities.
Step 4: |dentify the cardinality of the relationship, one-to-one, one-to-many or
many-to-many.

Step 5: Identify the modality of the relationships. Are they optional or
mandatory?
ERDs providea foundation to build a database. By modelling the components
of a database in a very clear manner it can be understood by other developers,
which improves database maintenance. Working through the model, you can
identify entities and relationships. Understanding the interconnectivity allows you
to spot mistakes before development begins.

@ Communication & Research skills
ERD diagrams communicate the schema of the database clearly so it can be
understood by many people. Developing ERD diagrams requires pattern
recognition.
Research in pairs the following questions.
*

How could ERD diagrams be seen as independent of languages?

*

How does the accepted universal ERD diagram enable the database
design to be understood by all designers?

*

What role do ERD models play in the acquisition of knowledge within
computer science?

answers? What differences do you have?
Work together as a four to create definitive answers you are all happy with.

A3.2.3 Outline the different data types used
in relational databases
The data types you have available for use in a database depend on the database
system you are using. Look at the documentation provided with your database
software. This book will refer to MySQL data types.
There are three main data types in MySQL: string, numeric and date/time. The
following examples are not exhaustive, but they outline the main data types
available of each kind.

* Fractional seconds precision: the timestamp stores the fraction of the second upto 6 digits of precision. 6-digit precision for seconds, for

example, gives the integer value plus 6 decimal digits (for example, 54.283483 seconds). This may seem excessive but, considering the
number of databases and the variety of data being stored worldwide, it can be very useful in a number of different scenarios.
*

To measure time very accurately. Measuring time in whole seconds would not work, for example, for measuring the fastest laps in a
Formula One race, or to decide the winner of the 100 m sprint at the Olympics.

*

When many events are happening at the same time. For popular events, such as festivals or music gigs, there can be thousands of people

inan online gueue and everyone wants to buy tickets at the same time. Using fractional seconds ensures everyone gets a fair place in
the queue.

*

When working with distributed databases, it is essential that transactions are coordinated. Using fsp can help to effectively manage
transactions.

178

A3.2 Database design

The data type informs MySQL what type of data is held within the data field and,
therefore, how it will interact with the data. For example, anything stored as a
string data type cannot have calculations performed upon it but numerical data
types can. Consistency is important when choosing data types so data can be
imported and updated correctly.

D iy

Developers must understand the data that they will need to store, so they can
understand what data types they will need to work with. To do this, they must
examine real-world problems.
When developing databases, you are often presented with documents
showing how the data is collected. These could be presented as online or
offline forms, posts or playlist details.
Using the screenshot ofa playlist in Figure 10, identify the:

If you do not choose the correct data type, you may get issues with data not
being used in the correct way. For example:
if data is stored as string, you may not be able to use it to perform calculations
if you want to query using dates, the data needs to be stored as a date
if you set it as ENUM—a predetermined list of values—then if the item is not on
the list, users will not be able to store the data they want to.

When developing databases,
developers make decisions
about what data will be stored
and what data types will be used
to store the data. This is a form
of knowledge classification:
developers have to determine the
acceptable values for each attribute
within the database.
The databases that store scientific
calculations are an example of
this. If the developer decides to
store the data as a float rather than
as a double, some accuracy may
be lost.
To what extent does the way
knowledge is classified using data
types affect what we can learn from
the data?

179

A3 Databases

A3.2.4 Construct tables for relational
databases
Building tables that make use of keys is essential when creating a relational
database. It is important you plan the tables correctly to ensure that data integrity
is always maintained. One problem ofa badly designed database is duplicated
data. Duplicated data can lead to problems with deletion since, if your data is
not linked together, there may be data left within the database resulting in wrong
results from queries (deletion anomaly). If data is updated and the data is not
correctly linked, not all associated records may be updated (update anomaly).
The correct linking of data can occur through keys.

A Figure 11 The relationship between entities using keys

Keys link data together, showing clearly that there is a relationship between the
two items and that they should be treated as related data.
Using keys, you can avoid deletion anomalies and update anomalies through
cascading. Delete cascade makes use of primary keys and foreign keys. When
a row with a primary key is deleted, all rows that are referenced with the foreign
key are also deleted. This removes all related data, ensuring data is left over in the
table.
Update cascade also makes use of primary keys and foreign keys. If a primary key
is updated in a table, all subsequent related rows are also updated. This ensures
data integrity across the tables.

A3.2 Database design

A3.2.5 Explain the difference between
normal forms
Databases that are not designed properly can have the following issues.
Insert anomalies: You cannot add data correctly as the data is dependent on
other attributes in the database.
Deletion anomalies: The database may have attributes that rely on nonrelated attributes. If you delete the non-related attributes, you unintentionally
lose data.
Update anomalies: Any update in a badly designed database will be a
challenge as you have to look through every section of the database to ensure all
items are deleted. This is not a challenge in a small database, but fora database

with hundreds thousands, or millions of records, this becomes a significant

problem.
Normalization is a developer's tool that ensures a database is correctly designed.
Normalization turns an unnormalized, badly organized database into a
well-designed database, minimizing the likelihood of anomalies occurring.
There are three stages of normalization you need to be aware of: unnormalized
to first normal form, first normal form to second normal form, and second normal

form to third normal form. In this course you need to know the differences
between the forms and be able to follow the steps to normalize a database
to third normal form. One of the main things you need to remember when
normalizing is:
The data should rely on the key,
the whole key and nothing but the key.
When creating databases, you are thinking about functional dependencies; that
is, what data relies on other data. Forexample, in Table 4, the primary key for
the patient indirectly tells you the patient’s name and address, as the primary
key is unique to this patient. Normalization makes use of these dependencies to
break down the original entity into smaller entities where all data is functionally
dependent on the key. Once you have a normalized database, you minimize the
chances of the anomalies occurring, and the database is more reliable.

Real-world systems are complex. Every interaction in
the real world has many nuances. Programmers need
to abstract the information into a general model that
works for many people. Consider the Amazon database.
This contains information about the products people
buy and the media (books, music, film, and television

what relationships they need to identify in that data to

The differences between normal forms may seem confusing at first: they are
outlined for you here.
First normal form: The repeating data is moved into a new entity. The nonrepeating data stays in its own entity and is given a unique identifier (primary
key). The primary key from the non-repeating entity is placed in the new entity
as a foreign key. In the new entity a unique identifier is found. This will most likely
be a composite key. The issue with the first normal form is that the new entity
will have attributes that only rely on one part of the key, known as partial key
dependencies. This does not align with the normalized database philosophy of
“the whole key and nothing but the key”.
Second normal form: The partial key dependencies are removed into their
own entity and a primary key is identified. The primary key features in the entity
it was removed from as both a primary key and a foreign key at this point. The
issue with second normal form is that some attributes in the entities do not rely
on the key, they are their own information. These are known as transitive or
non-key dependencies. These, again, do not align with the normalized database
philosophy of “the whole key and nothing but the key”.
Third normal form: The transitive or non-key dependencies are moved into their
own entity and given a primary key. The primary key becomes a foreign key in the
entity it was removed from. Transitive dependencies can be present in any of the
entities previously created. Once they are removed, your entities should meet
the normalized database philosophy of “the whole key and nothing but the key”.

A3.2 Database design

TOK
Explain the difference between the
normalization stages.

When normalizing data, developers make assumptions about the data they
have been given, deciding what data must be stored and what data can be
left out of the final data model. For example, developers may assume that
every ticket for a sporting event has a seat associated with it. What are the
roles of assumptions when developing a normalized database model?

A3.2.6 Construct a database normalized to
3NF for a range of real-world scenarios
In programming, encapsulating the data within a class keeps the data safe and
accurate. Entities in a database are similar. By keeping all data in one place and

minimizing duplication, the data is more secure.

Learn more about encapsulation

and information hiding in
section B3.1.5.

Two examples of how data normalizing is used in real-life scenarios are an
e-commerce database and a library database.

gifts to registered customers. Transactions store the item sold, the artist and
the seller.
An excerpt of the unnormalized flat file database is shown in Table 8. As you
can see in the excerpt, customer data is stored every time the customer makes a
purchase. The artist details are stored every time one of their products is sold.

Table 9 shows the normalization process for the negozio.com database. First
normal form removes the transaction data to a new table, adding the customer ID

as a foreign key. In second normal form, the item and artist data is removed as
this only relies on one part of the composite key. In third normal form, the artist
information is removed to a new table as the artist information does not depend
on the item’s primary key.

Library database
A library database is used to manage a group of libraries to record which books
have been borrowed and who has borrowed them. The database also stores
details of any outstanding fines per person. For this group oflibraries, a person
belongs to and can borrow books from only one library—they cannot borrow
books from other libraries in the group. An extract from the current unnormalized
flat file datzbase is shown in Table 10. Each time a person borrows a book, the
library data and the borrower information is stored. If a book is borrowed more
than once, the book data is also duplicated.

Table 11 shows the normalization process for the library database. First normal
form removes the borrower, book, and borrowing information into a new table.

Second normal form removes the book information as it does not rely on the
whole of the composite key. In third normal form, the borrower information is
removed as there are transitive dependencies within the loan table.

A3.2.7 Evaluate the need for denormalizing
databases

TOK
When developing databases, there
are many things to consider.

The first thing to note about denormalized databases is that these databases
have been previously normalized to a satisfactory level and denormalization has
occurred because this will optimize the database performance.
When a database that has been normalized is being queried heavily, the use of
joins to link the data can become very intensive and slow down the database
significantly. One way you can overcome this is to unnormalize the database,
meaning that you keep some of the data together despite this meaning some
data will be repeated. For example, in the online shopping database in Table 9,
the artist details may be stored with the item details as these are often presented
together, rather than having to join the tables each time the data is needed.

Imagine you are asked to develop
a database for a ferry company. You
need to consider:
*

Ship: Name, IMO number,
registration, capacity, number

of passengers, number of
vehicles, colour, captain.
*

Passengers: Name, address,
passport, destination, age,

Advantages and disadvantages of denormalizing
a database

nationality.
*

plate, size, manufacturer,

Advantages
*
»

Vehicle: Vehicle type, license
model, colour.

Simpler queries as the database has to look at fewer entities to collect all
the data.

*

Route: Start, end, duration,

weather, areas crossed.

Faster data retrieval as the database has fewer joins to complete.

*

More challenging updates and inserts as some of the data is repeated.

You can store many types of
data, but do you need to store
everything?

*

Updating code can be difficult to write as the data is in multiple places.

How can the abstraction of the data

*

There may be inconsistencies as there are duplicate copies of data.

help to model the real world within
a database?

*

The fact there are many copies of some data requires more storage.

Disadvantages

When deciding to denormalize a database, you need to balance having a
speedier, easier-to-query database against the challenges of storing multiple
copies of the data, leading to update and insertion challenges. Data warehouses
often use denormalized databases.

Database management systems use four different types of language to create
databases, manipulate databases, and enable safe interaction with the database.

The database management system can be thought of as an umbrella for each of
the languages. This is shown in Figure 12.

A Figure 12 An overview of the database languages

Data definition language
The data definition language (DDL) is used to create the database structures.
It is used to create the schema, the tables, and constraints within the database.

Using DDL statements, you can create the outline of the database.
Commands in the DDL include the following.
*

CREATE Used to create database objects.

*

ALTER Used to change the structure of the database.

*

DROP Used to delete objects from within the database structure.

191

A3 Databases

*

TRUNCATE Used to remove all records from the entity within the database
structure.

*

RENAME Used to rename an object within a database structure.

*

COMMENT Used to add a comment to the database structure.

Data manipulation language
The data manipulation language (DML) is used to access the data within the
database and to manipulate the data within the database. For example, querying
the database for information, updating records, and deleting records.
Commands in the DML include the following.
*

SELECT Used to retrieve data from the database.

*

INSERT Used to add data into the entity.

*

UPDATE Used to update the existing data within an entity.

*

DELETE Used to delete all records from an entity (but not the entity itself).

*

CALL Used to call an SQL operation.

*

LOCK TABLE Used to aid concurrency in the database.

Data control language
The data control language (DCL) is used to control access to the database.
The DCL helps to maintain security in the database as it allows user to have
access to the database or it can revoke data from the database.
Commands in the DCL include the following.

If you are studying at Higher Level,
you will learn more about this in
section A3.3.6.

*

GRANT Allows useraccess privileges in a database.

*

REVOKE Allows the removal of privileges in a database.

Transaction control language
The transaction control language (TCL) is used to complete the changes
in a database.
Commands in the TCL include the following.
*

COMMIT Used to complete queries and save them within the database.

*

ROLLBACK Used if there is an issue in an operation to restore the database
back to its last COMMIT statement.

TOK
The Oxford English Dictionary defines language as:
The system of spoken or written communication used by a particular
country, people, community, etc., typically consisting of words used
within a regular grammatical and syntactic structure; (also) a formal

system of communication by gesture, esp. as used by deaf people.

(Oxford English Dictionary, 2023)
Using the above definition to help you, to what extent do you believe that
DDL s a language?

A3.3 Database programming

Using SQLL to develop a database
The following SQLstatements are used to create data structures in the database.
For each example, the SQL command has been given and, when appropriate,
examples provided from an SQLlite database running in the DataGrip IDE.

A3.3.2 Construct queries between two

tables in SQL
Queries are used in databases to extract data and provide context for data.
Data within a database has little relevance unless it is put into context. Queries
can be used for filtering, which means finding the data you want to know from
the database, for example, all the customers in the database who own a specific
brand of car. Queries can be used for pattern matching—searching for patterns
in the data when you don’t know exactly what you are looking for, for example,
all customers who have bought a red item. Finally, queries can be used to order
data. For example, you may wish to find the top ten customers, and ordering the
data will enable you to see this information.

@ Thinking skills
Developing commands to extract data from databases requires algorithmic
thinking. Developing SQL statements requires you to think algorithmically.
Construct SQL statements to complete these database tasks.
1.

Create the database called Artefacts.

2.

Within the Artefacts database, add the following entities with the shown
attributes:
CURIO (Curio_ID (PK), Curio_name, Curio_Type)

CABINET (Cabinet
ID (PK), Cabinet Description,
Cabinet location)

Query An instruction developed in
SQL to extract information from the
database.

Social media sites use databases
to store masses of data points
identifying users’ likes and dislikes.
Online shops use databases
to store numerous data points

identifying consumer likes and
dislikes. To access this data and
make it useful, companies need to
manipulate the data using specialist
language.
To what extent
do a shared code
and language, such as those in the
SQL language, help or hinder the
pursuit of knowledge on a global
level?

COLLECTION (Cabinet
ID (PK/FK), Curio ID(PK/ID))
Like programming in SQL, in
section B2.3.2 you will construct
code to select data when specific
conditions are met.

195

A3 Databases

Tables 20 to 32 detail some useful SQL commands to extract data from a database.

% Table 20 SQL Select code
Command

Explanation of the command

SELECT

The Select operator returns selected attributes from a table. If you want to return all attributes from a table,
you use the * wildcard. You can also use the % wildcard to search fora specific substring within a text field.

Syntax
SELECT Attributel, Attribute2, Attribute3 FROM Table name;
SELECT * FROM Table name;

Example

Example

SELECT ArtistID,

ArtistName FROM

SELECT * from Artist;

Artist;

Output
Output

% Table 21 SQL Select distinct code
Command

Explanation of the command

SELECT
DISTINCT

The Select distinct operator only returns unigue values from the entity. For example, you may use it if you
wanted to find all the different types of items sold in a shop.

Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT Attributel, Attribute2, Attribute3
FROM table name;

Example
SELECT DISTINCT ItemID FROM Purchase;

Output

A3.3 Database programming

£, Table 22 SQL From code
Command

Explanation of the command

FROM

The From operator indicates the table where the data should be extracted from. This is
important, as if this is from one table, you do not need ajoin, but if the results are from two
or more tables, a join is required. You use this when you want to extract data from a table.

Syntax
SELECT * FROM Table name;

Example
SELECT *

from Customer;

Output

% Table 23 SQL Where code
Command

Explanation of the command

WHERE

The Where operator indicates there is a condition that has to be met when completing the select
statement. Similar to an If statement in programming, the data is only shown from the database
where the condition is met. You may use this to find all items over a certain price, or all customers
located in a certain country.

Syntax
SELECT Attributel, Attribute2, ...

FROM table name

WHERE condition;

Example
Select *

from Item WHERE

ItemCost > 300;

Output

197

Table 24 SQL Between code
Command

Explanation of the command

BETWEEN

The Between operator selects values between a range (inclusive of the start and end values). The
Between operator works on numbers, text or dates. You may use this if you want to find all items
in the database within a certain price range.

Syntax
SELECT * FROM table name
WHERE

attributel BETWEEN valuel AND

valueZ2;

Example
Select

*

from Item WHERE

BETWEEN

AND

:

Output

Table 25 SQL Order by code
Command

Explanation of the command

ORDER BY
ASC

The Order by operator is used to order the results either in ascending or descending order. The
data can be sorted on as many attributes are required. You may use this if you have lots of items
and you want to be able to find them quickly.

DESC

Syntax
SELECT * FROM table_
name

ORDER BY attribute ASC
or DESC;

Example
SELECT * from item
ORDER BY
ASC;

Output

1se programming

e Example

Output

SELECT * from item
ORDER BY

DESC,

ASC;

% Table 26 SQL Group by code
Command

Explanation of the command

GROUP BY

The Group by operator groups the rows that have the same values into summary rows. You may use
it to find the number of customers in a specific country.

Syntax
SELECT Attributel, Attribute2
FROM table name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY Attribute

ORDER BY Attribute

Example
SELECT * FROM Customer

% Table 27 SQL Having code
Command

Explanation of the command

HAVING

The Having operator is similar to the Where operator. It is a condition that has to be met before the data
is displayed. However, since Where cannot be used with the aggregate functions, the Having clause
must be used instead.

Syntax
SELECT COUNT

(Attribute), Attribute

FROM table name

GROUP BY attribute
HAVING COUNT (Attribute) condition;
Example
SELECT COUNT (CustomerID),
CustomerCountry
FROM Customer
GROUP BY CustomerCountry
HAVING COUNT (CustomerID) > 2;

Output

&, Table 28 SQlJoin code
Command | Explanation of the command
JOIN

The Join operator is used to combine rows from different tables when there is a common attribute between
them. The common attribute is known as the foreign key. There are several joins you need to know.
e

(Inner) JOIN Returns all the records that have matching values in both tables.

e

LEFT (outer) JOIN Returns all the records from the left table that have matched records on the right
table.

*

RIGHT (outer)JOIN Returns all the records from the right tables that have full matched records on the
left table.

Use this to collate information from across entities.

Syntax
SELECT table namel.attributel, table namel.attribute2, table namel.attribute3,
table name2.attribute2
FROM table namel

INNER JOIN table name2 WHERE tablenamel.attributel = tablenameZ2.attribute2;
Example
SELECT Item.ItemID,
Artist.ArtistEmail

Item.ItemDesc,

Item.ItemCost,

Item.ArtistID, Artist.ArtistName,

FROM Item
INNER JOIN Artist ON Item.ArtistID = Artist.ArtistID

WHERE ItemCost > 100;

A3.3 Database programming

£, Table 29 SQl like code
Command

Explanation of the command

LIKE

The Like operator is used within the Where operator to look for non-exact matches. This is known as
pattern matching within the attribute.
There are two wildcards used within the database system.
*

_represents one single character.

*

g represents any number of characters (zero, one, or many). Use this when you do not know how
many characters you are looking for.

This operator can be used to extract all data when you are not sure of the exact match. The example
below shows all artists containing the word “waork™. A join has been used to match the Artist information
from the Artist table to all products from the Product table containing the word “work”.
Syntax
SELECT Attributel, Attribute2

FROM table name
WHERE Attribute LIKE pattern;

Example
SELECT * from Artist
WHERE ArtistName LIKE

'%work':;

Output

Example
SELECT Item.ItemCost,

Item.ItemDesc,

Item.ArtistID,

Artist.ArtistName

FROM Item

JOIN Artist on Artist.ArtistID = Item.ArtistID
WHERE Artist.ArtistName LIKE 'S%work';

Explanation of the command

NOT

The Not operator
is used to exclude certain data. If you know what you want to exclude rather than
what you want to include, then this is the best option.
This could be used if you want to exclude all customers from ltaly and France.

Syntax
SELECT Attributel, Attribute2

Example (without Join)
SELECT * from Customer
WHERE NOT CustomerCountry =

'Italy' AND NOT CustomerCountry =

A3.3.3 Explain how SQL can be used to
update data in a database
Indexes in databases are used to speed up queries. They provide a method to
quickly look up the data. Rather than having all the data in the table, an index is a
pointer
to the data in the table—similar to an index in a book.

A3.3 Database programming

Indexes are required in very large databases due to the volume of data that is
being processed at any given time. For example, imagine you are in a library but
the information and books are not organized in any particular way. You would
have to spend a long time looking for the information or book. In a normal
library, all the data is indexed using a classification system. You can use the index
to locate information quickly. Databases are similar. They contain thousands,
millions, or billions of records, potentially containing petabytes of data. Being
able to access data quickly is essential for companies to run efficient queries.
Indexes help to serve as lookup tables to quickly retrieve data.
Databases store data in rows organized into tables. Each row has a primary key
that uniquely identifies the data in the rows. These keys are stored in indexes to
access the data quickly. Each time a new data item is created, the index needs to
be automatically updated, and this can take time.
There are three update operations available in a database: adding, modifying,
and removing. Every time each one of these updates is made, indexes need to
be rebuilt and reorganized, which adds a significant overhead to the operation.

There are vast data repositaries on the internet.

Worldwide.espacenet.com is a database storing all
the patents that have been filed and granted in the
European Union. When querying the database, you
can see all ideas that are protected and cannot be used
without permission when developing new inventions.

*

The Library of Congress in the USA which stores
information about current laws in the USA, the USA

copyright office, and the prints and photographs
office. When querying this database, you can discover
what is and is not within copyright, and you can find
information regarding laws and how the laws are
applied in specific situations.

The gapminder.org database from the World Health
Organization allows you to search development
indicator metrics for all countries across the world
and then download the data as a spreadsheet to
manipulate. This data can show you factors, such
as birth rate, GDP or the number of years students
spend in school, for one specific country or fora
whole region.

You have access to all of this information. When
developing knowledge claims in TOK, consider: how can
the data retrieved from databases be used to support the
knowledge claims you develop?

A3.3.4 Construct calculations within a

database using SQL's aggregate functions
Aggregate functions allow you to perform calculations on the data in the
database. Databases are used to support strategic decision-making within a
company. They can also be used by small independent users to perform data
analytics on their own data, such as: the average number of items sold, the
maximum sales, the sum of the sales, and so on.

Analytic functions you can perform include average, count, max, min and sum.
Average: This finds the average of a value in the database.

% Table 34 SQL code to perform averaging calculations on data in a database
Syntax

Example and description

SELECT AVG(Attribute)

SELECT AVG (Purchase.Quantity)

FROM Table Name;

from Purchase;

Output

This shows the average number of items purchased by each person in the
database in the purchase table.

A3.3 Database programming

e

SELECT AVG(Attribute)

SELECT AVG

(Purchase.Quantity)

from Purchase

FROM Table name

Where CustomerID = 3;

WHERE Attribute = value;

Output

This shows the average number of items purchased by the customer with the
CustomerlD 3.
Count: This returns the number of rows that match a specific criterion.
% Table 35 SQL code to perform count calculations on data in a database
Syntax
SELECT COUNT

Example and description
(Attribute)FROM

Table Name;

SELECT Count

(ItemID)

FROM Purchase;

Output

This operation counts the number of ltem|Ds that appear within the
purchase entity. This does include duplicates.
SELECT COUNT (Attribute)

Select Count(ItemID)
FROM Purchase

FROM Table Name

WHERE Quantity>1;

WHERE condition;

Output

This operation counts the number of ltem|Ds that appear within the
purchase entity when more than one item has been ordered. This does
include duplicates.
SELECT COUNT

This operation counts the number of itemlDs ltem|Ds that appear within
the purchase entity. However, this only counts the unique item|Ds,
ltemIDs not the duplicates.
