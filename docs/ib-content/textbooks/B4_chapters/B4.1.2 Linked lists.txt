M Linked list structure

A linked list consists of two main elements: nodes and pointers.
Nodes are the data element of the list. This could be a single piece of data, or it may be an

4 Node: a basic unit
of a data structure,

object containing multiple data. There are two particularly important nodes: the head and the

tail. The head is the first node in the linked list and the tail is the last. These help us navigate

# Pointer: a variable
that stores the memory
address of another
variable, typically used
in programming to
reference, or access, the

Pointers are contained within the node. These point to the next node in the list (and

sometimes the previous). A pointer may also be referred to as a reference, as it refers to the
memory address of where the next node resides.

To visualize a linked list, you might imagine it as a chain of elephants, where each elephant
represents a node. The trunk of one elephant extends to the tail of the next, similar to how pointers
connect one node to another in a linked list.

Bl Advantages and disadvantages of linked lists
Advantages
B Dynamic data structures: Due to their implementation, linked lists are dynamic data
structures. This means that they can grow and shrink in size as we add and remove nodes.
This is unlike an array, which is a static data structure.

B Memory utilization: Linked lists can be more efficient with memory usage, as they do not
create a reserved space in memory like an array does when it is declared.
B Efficient insertion and deletion: Linked lists generally outperform arrays when inserting

or deleting data due to their dynamic nature.
# Heap space: a region
of dynamically allocated
memory managed by
the operating system
where programs store
variables and data
structures that require
memory allocation
during runtime, allowing
for flexible memory
usage that can grow
and shrink as needed by
the application.

Disadvantages
B Sequential access: As linked lists cannot be accessed via an index like arrays, searching

a linked list requires a linear search algorithm, where you start at the head node and
continue traversing until you find what you are looking tor. This means that using a binary
search algorithm, for example, is not possible on a linked list. For large data structures,
this restriction when searching can be very time consuming when compared to accessing
an array.
B Memory utilization: Each node requires a reference to the next (and possibly the previous)

node, as well as storing the data within it. This takes up system resources in the primary
memory. As linked lists can grow, they potentially can go beyond the system resources that
are available, causing a heap exhaustion as the system will run out of heap space.

W Singly linked list

This is the simplest of the three types. Each node contains a single pointer pointing to the next
node in the list. The tail nodes contain a pointer that points to null (or none). This can be used

to recognize the end of the list when traversing it.

M Doubly linked list

These differ from singly linked lists because the nodes have two pointers — one reference to the

next node in the list and one to the previous. This allows for easier traversing of the list, as you
can move forward and backward with ease.

These are similar to singly linked lists, but with one major difference: the tail node, instead of
pointing to null, points back to the head node. This allows for circular, continuous traversal of

the list. Doubly linked lists can also be implemented in this manner.

(;Common mistake
Do not forget to label the head and to paint the tail node to null (or to the head node in a circular
linked list).

(;Top tip!
Remember to clearly show the node, as illustrated above. It should be represented as a box, divided
into either two or three sections. The pointers should be arrows clearly indicating the node they are
referring to.
