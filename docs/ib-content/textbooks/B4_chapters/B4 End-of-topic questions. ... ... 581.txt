Introduction
The Diploma Programme (DP) computer science course is designed for students in the 16 to 19 age group. The
curriculum seeks to examine key concepts in computer science: computer fundamentals, networks, databases and
machine learning, and then apply practical skills to support the computational thinking process to solve problems. As
with all the components of the DP, this course fosters the IB learner profile attributes (see page vi) in the members of
the school community.

Syllabus structure
Topics are organized into two separate themes:
*

Theme A: Concepts of computer science

*

Theme B: Computational thinking and problem-solving

These themes represent the connection between abstract ideas of how computing system operate (Theme A) and
their application using the practical skills of computer science to solve problems through the process of computational
thinking (Theme B).
Theme A: Concepts of computer science

Theme B: Computational thinking and
problem-solving
