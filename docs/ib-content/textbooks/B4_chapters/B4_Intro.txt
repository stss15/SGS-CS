Areas of Knowledge (AOKs) and ADTs: Guiding questions
B How does abstraction in ADTs mirror abstraction in other disciplines?
B To what extent is modularity essential for organizing and simplifying complex systems?

-

Abstraction and modularity are key concepts in ADTs. In groups, investigate how
abstraction and modularity are applied in their assigned AOK, such as natural sciences,
arts and mathematics. Consider:
B How is abstraction used to simplify complex ideas?
B Are there risks or benefits to simplifying reality through abstraction?
B How does modularity help organize knowledge or creativity in these fields?
Present your findings and discuss as a class.
