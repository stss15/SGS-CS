B1 Computational thinking

Once those are clearly defined, in collaboration with the main stakeholders you should outline
the objectives and goals of the proposed solution, identifying what needs to be solved and what

you want to achieve.
Every solution will include some form of input and output. Knowing how the input is being
provided, which input is supplied and the expected outcome or output to be produced

will help you understand the required process to reach your goal. The input can be in
different forms:
B Direct entry (by using barcode scanners; OCR or OMR scanners; or MICR readers)
B Manual entry (keyboard, joystick, touch screen, touch pad or mouse entry, or data
manually being entered by human operators)
B Automatic data entry (by using sensors: temperature, light, infrared, pressure, and so on).
Each of those has advantages and disadvantages. For example, manual entry might be cheaper,
but it is prone to errors, while automatic entry is clearly more expensive due to the hardware
or software involved, but it is more accurate and faster.
‘When it comes to output, this can be classitied as temporary output (displaying the
information on a screen), permanent output (printing the data), or electrical or mechanical
output (using actuators: switches or relays).
Identifying the input data required and the output expected helps in outlining the data flow
and understanding how the data travels through the proposed solution.

Performance issues related to the lack of identifying limitations and constraints, and inputs and

B1.1 Approaches to computational thinking

Imagine you must design and create an online platform to be used globally.
There are several constraints and limitations to take into consideration to ensure the
platform is scalable, user friendly, efficient and accessible across different regions.
Discuss:
® language and regional differences, e.g. currencies, languages supported, date
formats, units of measurement
B legal requirements, e.g. GDPR in Europe
B consumer-protection laws
/ content restrictions
B cultural differences and user behaviours that impact the design of the platform,
e.g. meanings of colours for different cultures, sensitivity of specific content, userinterface alignment (left to right or right to left), time zones, scheduling.
How do such constraints support or limit the development of online platforms that can
be used worldwide?

Is targeting a local market more advantageous and efficient, rather than targeting a
global market?

B1.1.2 Fundamental concepts of
computational thinking
B Abstraction
# Abstraction: having
a higher-level, simplified
maodel to represent
a complex system. It
allows you to focus
on the core ideas or
concepts that matter,

without being overly
concerned about the
intricate details of
implementation.

Abstraction is the process of extracting essential information, while disregarding irrelevant
data, to propose or outline a feasible solution to a given problem. In this way, simplified
models can be designed; models that exclude unnecessary details. This plays a crucial role in
providing a solution that satisfies the user requirements and needs, as it solves the problem
without including unnecessary features, and in a shorter period due to the reduced amount of

code written.
Real-world examples of abstraction include designing a map as a representation of a territory;
a painting as a representation of a landscape; and a timetable. In programming, abstraction is
an important concept in object-oriented programming. It is used to hide complexity from the

user by:
B abstracting data entities (by hiding data entities via a data structure, reducing the body of
the data to a simplified version of the whole)

B hiding underlying implementation of a process (programmers don’t need to know details
of how the subroutines are implemented, or what other subroutines they call, but they can
simply use them to serve their purpose).
By using abstraction:
B the time required to create a piece of software is reduced

m the program becomes smaller in size, so it requires less space in memory and the download
times are reduced
B customer satisfaction increases, as their requirements are met without extra features.

B1 Computational thinking

(®Tok
What counts as knowledge?
The map as an abstraction of the territory: A map is not the actual territory it represents, but rather
a diagrammatical representation of an area, including some features and excluding others. The
London Tube map was designed in 1933 as a simplified model of reality, informing the traveller
how to navigate between stations, but excluding many other details and not providing an accurate
representation of the actual space. Investigate and identify the differences between the London
Tube map and other subway maps that you know.
Knowing the map doesn’t mean that you know much about the actual territory, just as knowing
the names of different items in different languages doesn't reflect your knowledge about the
items themselves.

Watch Richard Feynman's "Names Don't Constitute Knowledge”, or analyse the following quotation
to further explore the concept:

Naming things is a human act; it is not an act of nature. We are the ones who,

through language, create things out of the phenomena around us. Yet we forget
that we control this process and let the process control us. Naming things — using
language — is a very high-level abstraction, and when we name something we
“freeze” it by placing it in a category and making a “thing” out of it. Language is
a map, but three important things to remember about maps are: the map is not the
territory; no map can represent all aspects of the territory; and every map reflects
the mapmaker’s point of view.
Lutz, Wiliam (1996) The New Doublespeak: Why No One Knows What

Anyone is Saying Anymore. HarperCollins, New York, NY.

Investigate how knowing the name of something can positively or negatively influence our
life experiences.

B Algorithmic design
Before starting to write actual code, you should analyse and identify the requirements of the
problem and then understand the logical steps required to solve the problem. Once you have

a firm grasp of the requirements, the next step involves designing a potential solution. One
effective approach for achieving this is to create an algorithm. This involves creating step-by-

step solutions with predictable outcomes.
# Algorithm: a finite
sequence of instructions
that needs to be
followed step-by-step to
solve a problem.

An algorithm is a structured set of sequential instructions designed to address and resolve
a problem.

Consider the following problem:
“A user is required to provide two whole numbers. Construct a program that calculates the
sum of the two numbers and displays it.”

The algorithm corresponding to the problem above is:
Step 1: Ask the user to enter a number.
Step 2: Store this number.
Step 3: Ask the user to enter another number.

Step 4: Store this new value.
Step 5: Add the two numbers together.
Step 6: Store the result.
Step 7: Display the result.

B1.1 Approaches to computational thinking

Those steps need to be very specific and in the right order to be able to solve the problem. By
applying algorithmic designs, you will develop algorithmic thinking skills that will help you
develop efficient problem-solving techniques, by using structured and systematic algorithms.

(;Top tip!
When outlining algorithms, ensure the instructions are very specific, clear and in the right order. Not
following the required order often leads to the wrong solution or different errors. Imagine you need
to calculate the average of three numbers. Setting the value of sum to 0 after storing the total of
the three values into the variable sum and attempting to divide this by 3 afterwards would produce
an error.

B Decomposition
# Decomposition:
breaking down complex

Decomposition refers to breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable
parts. After designing solutions to those smaller problems, they can be put together to build up

problems into smaller,

a final solution to the complex problem. This concept supports modularity, allowing multiple

more manageable parts.

programmers or experts to collaborate and work simultaneously on solving the problem.

# Pattern recognition:
identifying similarities in
the details of problems.

In programming, decomposition is often used to structure the solution, by designing several
methods or functions.

(;Common mistake
Students do not always use terminology in an appropriate and competent way, and may approach
questions by providing general superficial knowledge, which does not gain full marks.
Students often define "decomposition” as breaking down a program into smaller sub-programs.
This isn't accurate as, at the stage decompasition accurs, there is no program created, therefore
the problem is the one being broken down into smaller, more manageable parts.

B Pattern recognition
Pattern recognition refers to identifying similarities in the details of problems. This simplifies
the process of finding a solution by identifying patterns and focusing on reusing solutions
proposed to solve those similarities. This means that you will develop reusable code in the
form of functions or procedures; reuse existing code that has already been tested; and support
the use of modularity, which reduces the development time.

B1.1.3 How fundamental concepts of
computational thinking are used to approach
and solve problems in Computer Science
4 Computational
thinking: a toolkit of
available technigues
for problem-solving; its
fundamental concepts
are abstraction,

decomposition,
algorithmic thinking and
pattern recognition.

Computational thinking is not programming, and it does not make you think like a computer,
but rather it makes you think like a computer scientist. It is a toolkit of available techniques

for problem-solving. This gives you the skills to efficiently outline a problem specification; to
analyse, understand and simplify the problem; and to identity and choose optimal solutions to

different problems.
The fundamental concepts of compurational thinking, such as abstraction, decomposition,

algorithmic thinking and pattern recognition, can be used to solve real-world problems,
for example: software development, data analysis, machine learning, database design and

network-security problems.
B1 Computational thinking

In each of the areas identified above, all the fundamental concepts are equally important:
m Software development: You cannot create a program before:
0 understanding the problem

0 making abstraction of unnecessary details
0 finding repeating patterns

O designing efficient algorithms
Without any of these steps, the software produced might lack accuracy or might not be as
efficient as it should be.
B

Games development: Abstraction is used when the players are provided with a series
of clues, some of which are intended to mislead the players. Abstraction refers to
disregarding unnecessary details. Players should disregard such clues and focus on the
important details.

B Programming: Programming languages oftfer libraries with functions and methods for
programmers to use. The programmer makes an abstraction of the way those functions

were written, focusing on correctly using them to complete their code.
B Data analysis: Computational thinking is used to automate repetitive tasks, predict market
trends and improve customer service. Data analysts identify patterns (for example popular
products for a category of people, repetitive tasks, frequent customer complaints) and apply
algorithmic thinking to propose feasible solutions and break problems into simpler steps,
saving hours of extra work on a weekly basis.
B Machine learning: Pattern recognition is an important concept, used in classifying
data by finding patterns in large amounts of data, for example predicting purchasing
behaviour based on buying habits. It can also be used to identify the skills required to be
a good football player, by analysing video recordings to automatically find patterns in the
behaviour of professional players. The same task might make use of abstraction to exclude
irrelevant information provided by the videos and algorithms to promote those skills

among new players during their virtual training sessions.
B Database design: Abstraction can be used to identify which data sources are relevant and
which can be disregarded. Decomposition can be used to design relational databases by

breaking down the complex problem into smaller ones. Entities can be represented as
tables, and relations shown between them.

m Database normalization: Pattern recognition can be used to ensure there are no repeated
groups of attributes or algorithmic design in outlining the tables’ structures, and identify

the logic behind the types of relationships established between tables.
B Network security: For solving network-security problems, abstraction enables the

generalization of complex security models; decomposition is used to break down
cybersecurity ecosystems into models that allow a clear identification of their security

roles; pattern recognition is used to outline ways to identify and classify possible threats to
the network; and algorithmic design is used to propose clear, step-by-step instructions on

how to deal with such risks in similar situations.

B1.1 Approaches to computational thinking

(®Tok
Knowledge and Al
Al is rapidly improving, and it can easily achieve goals that pecple previously considered impossible.
Machines can spot patterns at amazing rates, take dedisions, output surprising results and even
learn new things. But how do they get access to their wide range of data? What is the role of our
digital footprint in improving machine learning techniques? And does online data about you give the
full picture of what you are really like as a human being? Systems predicting human behaviour could
lead to discrimination, so how do we ethically define the limits of knowledge that has been created
with the help of technology?
Machine learning pushes the boundaries of how we perceive knowledge. People are excellent at
generalizing, identifying patterns and predicting future actions or outcomes based on previous
experiences. However, recent technological developments show that machine learning can compete
with humans even in this area. Researchers are using symbolic and statistical Al to teach machines

to reason about what they see. They can beat humans at a chess game, create original or fake art
and provide medical diagnoses, and they can do all this with minimal or no human intervention.
What does this mean for knowledge? Can a machine ever “know” something? Could knowledge
reside outside human cognition?
To further explore the concept, try to create a deepfake video. How does this experience change
your view on the saying “seeing is believing”? How does not knowing how to distinguish between
good and bad knowledge influence our choices between the most appealing and the most
accurate information?

Reflective: Consider how you achieve success and how you could change your approach
when learning becomes challenging.
Sacial skills: Listen actively to other perspectives and ideas - there are different ways to
solve a problem, some better than others; listen to advice and try new techniques and
problem-solving strategies.

of an algorithm.
