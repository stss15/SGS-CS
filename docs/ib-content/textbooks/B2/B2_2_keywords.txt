# B2.2 Data Structures - Keywords and Definitions

## Static vs Dynamic Data Structures

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Static Data Structure | A data structure with predefined fixed size and elements stored in contiguous memory locations. |
| Dynamic Data Structure | A data structure that can grow or decrease at runtime, with elements stored in memory locations that are chained together, but not necessarily contiguous. |
| Direct Access | A method of access where elements are directly retrieved by using their index (position). |
| Sequential Access | A method of access where elements are checked one after another, from the beginning to the end of the data structure. |

## Arrays and Lists

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Array | A data structure that stores elements of the same data type under one single identifier (name). |
| Index | A value that indicates the position of an element in an array or list. |
| Parallel Arrays | Two or more arrays of the same size, where the element at a given index in one array corresponds to another element at the same index in another array. |

## Stacks

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Stack | An abstract data structure that works on the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. |
| LIFO (Last In First Out) | A principle where the last element inserted is the first element removed. |
| Push | A method for inserting an element at the top of a stack. |
| Pop | A method for deleting the element from the top of a stack. |
| Peek | A method for returning the top element of a stack without removing it. |
| Stack Pointer | A register used to store the memory address of the last added data in a stack, or sometimes the first available address in a stack. |
| Recursion | A process that uses a function or procedure that is defined in terms of itself and calls itself. |
| Interrupt | A signal sent from a device or software to request the processor's attention. |

## Queues

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Queue | An abstract data structure that works on the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. |
| FIFO (First In First Out) | A principle where the first element inserted is the first element removed. |
| Enqueue | A method of inserting an element at the rear of a queue. |
| Dequeue | A method of deleting an element from the front of a queue. |
