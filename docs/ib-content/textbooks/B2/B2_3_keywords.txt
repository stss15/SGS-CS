| Procedure | A set of statements that can be grouped together and called in a program as needed; they don't return a value. |
| Maintainable Code | Clear, easy-to-read and modify code that can be reused within the same program or in other programs. |

## Variable Scope

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Local Variable | A variable that exists only within the block of code where it is defined. |
| Global Variable | A variable that exists throughout a program. |
