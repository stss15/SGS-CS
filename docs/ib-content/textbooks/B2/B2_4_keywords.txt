Big O notation: used to find the upper bound (worst-case scenario) of the growth of a function; the longest time or space required to turn input into output.

Time complexity: a measure of how long an algorithm will take to run or how many steps an algorithm will take to run.

Space complexity: a measure of how much memory space it takes to run an algorithm.

O(1) - constant time: The algorithm performs a fixed number of operations; the time taken to run does not depend on the size of the input.

O(n) - linear time: The algorithm scales linearly with the size of the input.

O(n²) - quadratic time: The time taken to run the algorithm is directly proportional to the square of the input size.

O(log n) - logarithmic time: The algorithm's running time scales logarithmically with the increase in input size.

O(2ⁿ) - exponential time: The algorithm's running time doubles with every increase in the input size.

Linear search: a method of searching in which each element is checked in sequential order.

Binary search: a method of searching an ordered array by repeatedly checking the value of the middle element and disregarding the half that does not contain the searched element.

Bubble sort: a sorting algorithm that compares adjacent values and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Selection sort: a sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

Recursion: a technique where a function or procedure calls itself until a specific condition is met.

Base case: a terminating solution (that is not recursive) to a process.

General case: a process where the recursive call takes place.

Winding: a process occurring when recursive calls are made until the base case is reached.

Unwinding: a process occurring when the base case is reached and the values are returned to build a solution.
