A group of friends play a round-robin tournament game of table tennis, where each person plays against each other player
for 5 minutes at a time. The information from the tournament is recorded in parallel arrays (lists), NAMES and SCORES,

examples of which are shown below.
When two people have their round against each other, each player records the points they win in their assigned row, in the
column for the person they are playing against. For example, in the data set below, when Annabelle played against Jack,
SCORES[0] [3] shows that Annabelle scored 4 points, and scorgs [3] [0] shows that Jack scored 8 points.

Construct an algorithm that will declare and populate the NnaMES array (list), based on the example data above.
Identify the data type of the elements in the SCORES array (list).
Identify the winning player in the game between Claire and Benjamin.

Construct an algorithm that will print the names of players for every round, each player's respective scores and

who the winner was. If the game was a tie, output an appropriate message. For example:
Annabelle scored 3 vs Benjamin scored 5: Benjamin won
Annabelle scored 4 vs Claire scored 7. Claire won

Construct an algorithm that will declare two new parallel arrays (lists) to keep track of a leaderboard based on net

f

should be LeaderName and LeaderPoints. Each player’'s element in the LeaderPoints array should be the
total of points they won minus the total of points they conceded.
For example, the first two rows using the data above would be:
LeaderName
LeaderPoints
Annabelle
-5
(Annabelle won 19 points but conceded 24)
Benjamin
1
(Benjamin won 19 points and conceded 18)
Construct an algorithm that will sort the parallel arrays (lists) of LeaderName and LeaderPoints in descending

points each player has won. Perform the calculations necessary to populate these arrays. The two parallel arrays

order of LeaderPoints.

Construct an algorithm that will save the parallel arrays (lists) of NAMES and SCORES to names.txt and
scores.txt text files.
A company has exported its sales data from a spreadsheet to a couple of text files. NAMES.txt contains a list of the
names of its salespeople and SALES.txt contains a list of the total sales made by each person in the last month.
For example, the first few lines of each file may resemble the following:
NAMES txt
SALES.txt
Amina
23424
Carlos

a Construct an algorithm that will declare two parallel arrays or lists, NAMES and SALES, open the files and load
their content into the respective array or list. You may assume there is a maximum of 1000 entries in the file.
b Construct an algorithm that will use a recursive quicksort to sort the two parallel arrays or lists by SALES in
descending order.
¢ The content of the NAMES array (list) was iterated over with a loop, and its elements added into an empty stack
(element 0 was the first to be added to the stack). What can be said about the order of the NAMES that will be
popped off the stack in respect to their sales?

b Describe an application that uses a queue in a computer system.
5 State the efficiency of the quicksort algorithm in Big O notation.
6 Outline two uses of a stack in a computer system.
7 Outline the differences between storing a queue in a linear form as opposed to a circular form.
8 State which data type is best for storing a telephone number (e.g. 00352 661 008 990) and give two reasons.
9 Arrays or linked lists can be used to implement stacks and queues.
a Describe the advantage of using an array to implement a stack ora queue.
b Describe the advantage of using a linked list to implement a stack or a queue.
10 The following list of numbers needs to be put into ascending order:
3,1,7,2,4,1,6
State the list that would be obtained after two iterations of a selection sort.
