## Part 1: Variables, Data Types & Operators

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Variable | A named memory location used to store a value that can be changed during execution. |
| Data Type | Specifies what kind of data a variable can hold (e.g., Integer, Boolean). |
| Boolean | A data type used to store one of two possible values: true or false. |
| Char | A data type used to store a single character, digit, or symbol. |
| Increment | To increase a value by another value (usually by one). |
| Decrement | To decrease a value by another value (usually by one). |
| Arithmetic Operator | A character that is used to perform a calculation. |
| Boolean Operator | A character that represents a specific logical operation that is used to produce a true or false outcome. |
| Relational Operator | An operator used to compare values or expressions. |
| Binary Operator | An operator that requires two operands (values). |
| Unary Operator | An operator that requires one single operand. |
| Operand | A value used in a mathematical expression. |
| Integer Division | Division in which the fractional part is discarded. |
| Floating-point Division | Division in which the fractional part is kept. |

## Part 2: String Manipulation

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Concatenation | Joining strings together. |
| Substring | A function used to retrieve part of a string. |

## Part 3: Exception Handling & Debugging

| Keyword | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Exception | The event that interrupts the execution of a program. |
| Exception Handling | The actions taken to deal with an exception or how the system is prevented from halting unexpectedly. |
| Debugging | Finding and fixing errors in a program. |
| Trace Table | A technique used to test an algorithm, and to predict how it will be run and how values of variables will change. |
| Breakpoint | A marker to interrupt the execution of code for debugging purposes. |
