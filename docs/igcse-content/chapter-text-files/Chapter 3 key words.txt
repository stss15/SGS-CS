increasing CPU performance. More generally, cache means
any area of storage used to quickly access frequently-used
data - other examples include web cache, database cache,
DNS cache
register – a temporary component in the CPU which can be
general or specific in its use; it holds data or instructions as
part of the Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle

instruction set – the complete set of machine code
instructions used a particular microprocessor
embedded system – a combination of hardware and
software designed to carry out a specific set of functions
barcode – a series of dark and light lines of varying
thickness used to represent data; the code has to be

a file

resistors create heat and form an ink bubble which is
ejected onto paper in an inkjet printer

charge couple device (CCD) – a light sensitive cell made up
of millions of tiny sensors acting as photodiodes

piezoelectric crystal – a crystal located in an ink reservoir
within an inkjet printer; the crystal vibrates and forces ink
out onto paper
