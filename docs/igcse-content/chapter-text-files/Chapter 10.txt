10 Boolean logic
In this chapter, you will learn about:
★ the identification, definition, symbols and functions of the standard logic gates:
NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR
★ how to use logic gates to create logic circuits from:
– a given problem
– a logic expression
– a truth table
★ how to complete truth tables from:
– a given problem
– a logic expression
– a logic circuit
★ how to write a logic expression from:
– a given problem
– a logic circuit
– a truth table.

10.1 Standard logic gate symbols
Electronic circuits in computers, solid state drives and controlling devices
are made up of thousands of logic gates. Logic gates take binary inputs
and produce a binary output. Several logic gates combined together form a
logic circuit and these circuits are designed to carry out a specific function.
The checking of the output from a logic gate or logic circuit is done using a
truth table.
This chapter will consider the function and role of logic gates, logic
circuits and truth tables. Also a number of possible applications of logic
circuits will be considered. A reference to Boolean algebra will be made
throughout the chapter; but this is really outside the scope of this text book.
However, Boolean algebra will be seen on many logic gate websites and
is included here for completeness, since many students may prefer this
notation to logic statements.

10.1.1 Logic gate symbols
Six different logic gates will be considered in this chapter:

NOT gate

AND gate

OR gate

NAND gate

NOR gate

XOR gate

▲ Figure 10.1 Logic gate symbols

Truth tables
Truth tables are used to trace the output from a logic gate or logic circuit. The
NOT gate is the only logic gate with one input; the other five gates have two
inputs (see Figure 10.1).
Although each logic gate can only have one or two inputs, the number of
inputs to a logic circuit can be more than 2; for example, three inputs give a
possible 23 (=8) binary combinations. And for four inputs, the number of possible
binary combinations is 24 (=16). It is clear that the number of possible binary
combinations is a multiple of the number 2 in every case. The possible inputs in
a truth table can be summarised as shown in Table 10.1.

10 Boolean logic

You will notice in the Boolean algebra, three new symbols; these have the
following meaning:
» . represents the AND operation
» + represents the OR operation
» a bar (above the letter or letters, e.g. a) represents the NOT operation.

10.3 Logic circuits, logic expressions, truth
tables and problem statements
When logic gates are combined together to carry out a particular function, such
as controlling a robot, they form a logic circuit. The following eight examples
show how to carry out the following tasks:
» Create a logic circuit from a:
– problem statement (examples 6 and 7)
– logic or Boolean expression (examples 3 and 8)
– truth table (examples 4 and 5)
» Complete a truth table from a:
– problem statement (examples 6 and 7)
– logic or Boolean expression (examples 3 and 8)
– logic circuit (example 1)
» Write a logic or Boolean expression from a:
– problem statement (examples 6 and 7)
– logic circuit (example 2)
– truth table (examples 4 and 5).

Example 1
Produce a truth table for the following logic circuit (note the use of black circles at the
junctions between wires):
A
B

P

R
X

Q
C

Part 1

Part 2

Part 3

▲ Figure 10.8

There are three inputs to this logic circuit, therefore, there will be eight possible
binary values that can be input.
To show stepwise how the truth table is produced, the logic circuit has been split up
into three parts, as shown by the dotted lines, and intermediate values are shown as
P, Q and R.

Part 1

A

P

B

This is the first part of the logic circuit; the first task is to find the intermediate values
P and Q.
The value of P is found from the AND gate where the inputs are A and B. The value
of Q is found from the NOR gate where the inputs are B and C. An intermediate truth
table is produced using the logic function descriptions in Section 10.2.

output, R:
This produces the following intermediate truth table. (Note: even though there are
only two inputs to the logic gate, we have generated eight binary values in part 1 and
these must all be used in this second truth table).

Example 2
Write logic expressions from the following logic circuits:
a

Logic gate 1

Logic gate 3

Logic gate 2

▲ Figure 10.12

The first action is to look at the gates connected to the inputs A, B and C:

logic gate 1:

(A AND B)

logic gate 2:

(B OR C)

We then join these together using logic gate 3:
[(A AND B)] XOR [(B OR C)] which gives us the required logic expression.
(Note: the square brackets “[ ]” in the expression are not necessary and are used here
just for clarity.)

This would be written as: (A AND B) XOR (B OR C)

10 Boolean logic
Again, we will do this in the order of logic gates 1 and 2 first (connected to the three
inputs):

logic gate 1:

(A NAND C)

logic gate 2:

(B AND C)

However, logic gate 3 is also connected to one of the inputs so that should be done next:

logic gate 3:

(logic gate 1) NOR A

If we replace (logic gate 1) by the logic expression above, we get:
		

((A NAND C) NOR A)

Finally, we can join all these together using:

logic gate 4:

((A NAND C) NOR A) OR (B AND C)

To produce the logic statement, we only concern ourselves with the truth table row where
the output value is 1. In this case, A = 1 and B =

10.3 Logic circuits, logic expressions, truth tables and problem statements

Example 6
A safety system uses three inputs to a logic circuit. An alarm, X, sounds if input A
represents ON and input B represents OFF; or if input B represents ON and input C
represents OFF.
Produce a logic circuit and truth table to show the conditions that cause the output X to be 1.
The first thing to do is to write down the logic statement representing the scenario
in this example. To do this, it is necessary to recall that ON = 1 and OFF = 0 and also
that 0 is usually considered to be NOT 1.
So we get the following logic expression:

(A AND NOT B)       OR       (B AND NOT C)

this equates to:
A is ON and B is OFF

the two parts are
connected by the OR gate

this equates to
B is ON AND C is OFF

Note: this expression can also be written as follows (Boolean expression):

—)
(A . —
B ) + (B . C
The logic circuit is made up of two parts as shown in the logic expression. We will produce
the logic gate for the first second part. Then join both parts together with the OR gate.

Now combining both parts with the OR gate gives us:

In order to produce the truth table, there are two ways to do this:
» trace through the logic circuit using the method described in example 1 (Section 10.3)
» produce the truth table using the original logic expression; this second method
has the advantage that it allows you to check that your logic circuit is correct.

(Note: it is optional whether to leave in the intermediate values or simply remove them

Example 7
A wind turbine has a safety system which uses three inputs to a logic circuit. A certain
combination of conditions results in an output, X, from the logic circuit being equal to 1.
When the value of X = 1 then the wind turbine is shut down.
The following table shows which parameters are being monitored and form the three
inputs to the logic circuit.

0

wind velocity <= 120 kph

1

The output, X, will have a value of 1 if any of the following combination of conditions occur:
Either

turbine speed <= 1000 rpm and bearing temperature > 80°C

Or

turbine speed > 1000 rpm and wind velocity > 120 kph

Or

bearing temperature <= 80°C and wind velocity > 120 kph

Design the logic circuit and complete the truth table to produce a value of X = 1 when
either of the three conditions above occur.
In this example, a real situation is given and it is necessary to convert the information
into a logic expression and then produce the logic circuit and truth table. It is
advisable in problems as complex as this to produce the logic circuit and truth table
separately (based on the conditions given) and then check them against each other to
see if there are any errors.

10.3 Logic circuits, logic expressions, truth tables and problem statements

Stage 1
The first thing to do is to convert each of the three statements into logic expressions.
Use the information given in the table and the three condition statements to find how
the three parameters S, T and W are linked. We usually look for the key words AND,
OR and NOT when converting actual statements into logic.
We end up with the following three logic expressions:
i turbine speed <= 1000 rpm and bearing temperature > 80°C
logic expression: (NOT S AND T)
ii turbine speed > 1000 rpm and wind velocity > 120 kph
logic expression: (S AND W)
iii bearing temperature <= 80°C and wind velocity > 120 kph
logic expression: (NOT T AND W)

Stage 2
This now produces three intermediate logic circuits:
i

S

T

▲ Figure 10.28

ii

S
W

▲ Figure 10.29

iii

T

W

▲ Figure 10.30

Each of the three original statements were joined together by the word ‘OR’. Thus,
we need to join all of the three intermediate logic circuits by two OR gates to get the
final logic circuit.
We will start by joining i and ii together using an OR gate:
S

T

W

318281_C10_CAM_IGCSE CO_SCI_356_386.indd 373

2/18/21 12:15 PM

10 Boolean logic
Finally, we connect the logic circuit in Figure 10.31 to Figure 10.30 to obtain the
answer:
S

T

X

W

▲ Figure 10.32

The final part is to produce the truth table. We will do this using the original logic
statement. This method has the bonus of allowing an extra check to be made on the
logic circuit in Figure 10.32 to see whether or not it is correct. It is possible, however,
to produce the truth table straight from the logic circuit in Figure 10.32.
There were three parts to the problem, so the truth table will first evaluate each part.
Then, by applying OR gates, as shown below, the final value, X, is obtained:
i
ii
iii

(NOT S AND T)
(S AND W)
(NOT T AND W)

We find the outputs from parts (i) and (ii) and then OR these two outputs together to
obtain a new intermediate, which we will now label part (iv).
We then OR parts (iii) and (iv) together to get the value of X.

Extension
The following two exercises are designed to help
students thinking of furthering their study in Computer
Science at A Level standard. The two topics here are
not on the syllabus and merely show how some of the
topics in this chapter can be extended to this next level.
The two topics extend uses of logic circuits in the real
world and the use of full adders and half adders.

Using logic ‘building blocks’
One very common ‘building block’ is the NAND
gate. It is possible to build up any logic gate,
and therefore any logic circuit, by simply linking
together a number of NAND gates. For example,
the AND, OR and NOT gates can be built from NAND
gates as shown here in Figure 10.34:

Topic 1: Logic circuits in the real world

The AND gate:

Anybody reading this chapter with an electronics
background will be aware that the design of logic
circuits is considerably more complex than has been
described.

This chapter has described in detail some of the
fundamental theories used in logic circuit design. This
will give the reader sufficient grounding to cover all
existing IGCSE and O Level syllabuses. However, it
is worth finally discussing some of the other aspects
of logic circuit design that will interest any student
considering the A Level course.
Electronics companies need to consider the cost of
components, ease of fabrication and time constraints
when designing and building logic circuits. We will
outline two possible ways electronics companies can
standardise logic circuit design:
» One method is to use ‘off-the-shelf’ logic units and
build up the logic circuit as a number of ‘building
blocks’
» Another method involves simplifying the logic
circuit as far as possible; this may be necessary
where room is at a premium (for example, in
building circuit boards for use in satellites to allow
space exploration).

Topic 2: Half adder and full adder circuits
In Chapter 10, the use of logic gates to create logic
circuits to carry out specific tasks was discussed
in much detail. Two important logic circuits used in
computers are:
» the half adder circuit
» the full adder circuit.
Half adder
One of the basic operations in any computer is binary
addition. The half adder circuit is the simplest circuit;
this carries binary addition on 2 bits generating two
outputs:

» the sum bit (S)
» the carry bit (C).
If you consider 1 + 1 this will give the result 1 0
(denary value 2). The ‘1’ is the carry and ‘0’ the sum.
As a truth table this is:

10 Boolean logic

As you have probably guessed already, the half adder
is unable to deal with the addition of more than two
bits (for example, an 8-bit byte). To enable this, we
have to consider the full adder circuit.

This is often shown in graphic form as:
A

S (sum)

1-bit

B

C (carry)

Or as a logic circuit:

See Section 1.1 for more details of
binary addition.

This is the sum produced from the addition
This is the carry from the previous bit position

The sum shows how we have to deal with CARRY from the
previous column. There are three inputs to consider in this third column,
for example, A = 1, B = 0 and C = 1 (S = 0). This is why we need to join
two half adders together to form a full adder, as shown in Figure 10.40

NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR
logic circuit – these are formed from a combination of logic gates and designed to carry out
a particular task; the output from a logic circuit will be 0 or 1
truth table – a method of checking the output from a logic circuit; a truth table lists all the
possible binary input combinations and their associated outputs; the number of outputs
will depend on the number of inputs; for example, two inputs have 22 (4) possible binary
combinations, three inputs have 2 3 (8) possible binary combinations, and so on

The system will sound an alarm (X) when certain conditions are detected. The
alarm will sound when:
temperature is > 200 degrees Celsius and the pressure is <= 5 bar
			or
speed is > 1 metre per second and the temperature <= 200 degrees Celsius
Draw a logic circuit to represent the above alarm system.
Logic gates used must have a maximum of two inputs.	

6 A DVD recorder is protected by three sensors (S, T and P). The output
from these sensors forms the inputs to a logic circuit. A certain
combination of input values produces an output of 1 from the logic circuit.
When this occurs a warning message is shown on the DVD display.
The following table shows which parameters are being monitored
and form the three inputs to the logic circuit:
