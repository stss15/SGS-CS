9.1 Databases
9.1.1 Single-table databases
A database is a structured collection of data that allows people to extract
information in a way that meets their needs. The data can include text, numbers,
pictures; anything that can be stored in a computer. Relational databases will be
studied at A Level but for IGCSE only single-table databases will be studied.
A single-table database contains only one table.

Why are databases useful?
Databases prevent problems occurring because:
» if any changes or additions are made it only has to be done once – data is
consistent
» the same data is used by everyone
» data is only stored once in relational databases which means no data duplication.

What are databases used for?
To store information about people, for instance:
» patients in a hospital
» pupils at a school.
Find out more
Find five more uses
for databases, and for
each one decide what
sort of information is
being stored.

To store information about things, for instance:
» cars to be sold
» books in a library.
To store information about events, for instance:
» hotel bookings
» results of races.

Fields and records – the building blocks for any database
Inside a database, data is stored in tables, which consists of many records. Each
record consists of several fields. The number of records in a table will vary as
new records can be added and deleted from a table as required. The number of
fields in a table is fixed so each record contains the same number of fields.
An easy way to remember this is: each record is a row in the table and each field
is a column in the table.
Note: while databases can contain multiple tables, all the databases considered
in this chapter will contain a single table.

Column

A table contains data about one type of item or person or event, and will be
given a meaningful name, for example:
» a table of patients called PATIENT
» a table of books called BOOK
» a table of doctor’s appointments called APPOINTMENT.
Each record within a table contains data about a single item, person or event, for
example:
» Winnie Sing (a hospital patient)
» IGCSE Computer Science (a book)
» 15:45 on January 2020 (an appointment).
As every record contains the same number of fields, each field in a record
contains a specific piece of information about the single item, person or event
stored in that record. Each field will have a meaningful name to identify the data
stored in it, for example:
» For a hospital patient the fields could include:
– The patient’s first name field called FirstName
– The patient’s family name field called FamilyName
– The patient’s date of admission field called DateOfAdmission

validation see
Section 7.5.

Validation
The role of validation was discussed in Section 7.5. It may be worth the reader
revisiting this part of the book before continuing with this chapter.
Some validation checks will be automatically provided by the database
management software that is used to construct and maintain the database. Other
validation checks need to be set up by the database developer during the
construction of the database.
The practical use of a database management system is strongly recommended
for all students. Practical examples will be used throughout this chapter. The
database management software used is Microsoft Access 365 as Microsoft Access is
used by most schools with students studying IGCSE Computer Science.
For example, the DateOfAdmission field will automatically be checked by the
software to make sure that any data input is a valid date before it can be stored
in the PATIENT table.

9.1 Databases

What is a data type?
Each field will require a data type to be selected. A data type classifies how the
data is stored, displayed and the operations that can be performed on the stored
value. For example, a field with an integer data type is stored and displayed as a
whole number and the value stored can be used in calculations.
These database data types are specified in the syllabus. They are available to use
as Access data types, but the names Access uses may be different from the terms
in the syllabus.

Using Access (or any
other suitable database
management software)

» Choose a suitable data type for each field.
» Include validation checks to make sure that the ward number has whole
number values from 1 to 10, and that the bed number has whole number values
from 1 to 8.
» Enter the following data in the PATIENT table:
Winnie Sing, 12/10/2022, Mr Smith, 6, 8
Steve Chow, 23/10/2022, Miss Abebe, 6, 3

You may want to look at the instructions on how to set up the CubScout database
later in this chapter if you have not set up a database before.

9.1.3 Primary keys
As each record within a table contains data about a single item, person, or event,
it is important to be able to uniquely identify this item. In order to reliably
identify an item from the data stored about it in a record there needs to be a
field that uniquely identifies the item. This field is called the primary key.

2/18/21 12:11 PM

9 Databases

A field that is a primary key must contain data values that are never repeated in
the table.
The primary key can be a field that is already used, provided it is unique, for
example the ISBN in the book table. The PATIENT table would need an extra field
for each record as all of the existing fields could contain repeated data. To create
a primary key, we could add a new field to each record, for example a unique
number could be added to each patient’s record. The extra field is:
» Primary key field called HospitalNumber

Activity 9.3
Using Access (or any other suitable database management software), add the
HospitalNumber field to the single table database PATIENT.
» Choose ‘text’ as the data type for this field.
» Include validation checks to ensure that 8 characters must be entered starting
with HN followed by 6 digits for example HN123456.
» Choose suitable data to store in each primary key field for the 6 patients in the
table.

Activity 9.4
1 Write down four database data types. Describe each data type and give an
example of a field where it would be a suitable choice.
2 Choose suitable words/phrases from the following list to correctly complete
the paragraph that follows:

9.1.4 SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard query language for writing
scripts to obtain useful information from a database. We will be using SQL
to obtain information from single-table databases. This will provide a basic
understanding of how to obtain and display only the information required from a
database. SQL is pronounced as es-queue-el.

2/18/21 12:11 PM

9.1 Databases

For example, somebody needing to visit a patient would only require the ward
number and the bed number of that patient in order to find where they are in the
hospital. Whereas a consultant could need a list of the names of all the patients
that they care for.

SQL scripts
An SQL script is a list of SQL commands that perform a given task, often stored
in a file so the script can be reused.
In order to be able to understand SQL and identify the output from an SQL script,
you should have practical experience of writing SQL scripts. You can write scripts
using SQL commands in Access. There are many other applications that also allow
you to do this – MySQL and SQLite are freely available ones. When using any SQL
application, it is important that you check the commands available to use as
these may differ slightly from those listed in the syllabus and shown below.
You will need to be able to understand and identify the output from the
following SQL statements.
SQL Query Statement

Description

SELECT

Fetches specified fields (columns) from a table; queries
always begin with SELECT.

FROM

Identifies the table to use.

WHERE

Includes only records (rows) in a query that match a given
condition.

ORDER BY

Sorts the results from a query by a given column either
alphabetically or numerically.

SUM

Returns the sum of all the values in a field (column). Used
with SELECT.

COUNT

Counts the number of records (rows) where the field
(column) matches a specified condition. Used with SELECT.

An SQL command:
Starts with

SELECT

			FROM
To identify
the fields
			:
to be displayed

			:
Ends with

To specify the
table to be used

;
To show the end of
the command

Only the SELECT and FROM commands are mandatory in an SQL script. All other
commands are optional.
A SELECT statement takes the form:
SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3, etc. – this specifies the individual
fields (columns) to be shown.
SELECT * – this specifies that all fields (columns) are to be shown.

9 Databases

A FROM statement takes the form:
FROM TableName – this specifies the table to use.
A WHERE statement takes the form:
WHERE Condition – this specifies the condition to apply.
Conditions often include values from fields, these values need to be stated in a
form that matches the data type for the field.

A SUM statement takes the form:
SELECT SUM (Field) – this specifies the field (column) for the calculation.
The field should be integer or real.
A COUNT statement takes the form:
SELECT COUNT (Field) – this specifies the field (column) to count if the
given criterium is met.

Example 1: Display consultant’s patients
For example, the following SQL command for the PATIENT single-table database
would provide a list of all Mr Smith’s patients showing the hospital number, first name
and family name for each of his patients.
SELECT HospitalNumber, FirstName, FamilyName
FROM PATIENT
WHERE Consultant = 'Mr Smith';
would display:

▲ Figure 9.5 Output from the PATIENT table showing Mr Smith’s patients

Example 2: Display consultant’s patients in
alphabetical order
This SQL command sorts the records in alphabetical order of family name:
SELECT HospitalNumber, FirstName, FamilyName
FROM PATIENT
WHERE Consultant = 'Mr Smith'
ORDER BY FamilyName;
would display:

Practical use of a database
As an IGCSE Computer Science student you need to be able to do the following:
» define a single-table database from given data storage requirements
» choose a suitable primary key for a database table
» read, complete and understand SQL scripts.
In order to do this, you will need to use a database management system. The
following case study shows how to set up a database with Microsoft Access 365
and complete the tasks described above.
Boys and girls between the ages of seven and eleven can join a cub scout group.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cub_Scout). Each cub scout group needs to keep
records about its members. Most groups will keep the following information
about each cub in their group:

Extension
For those students interested in studying Computer
Science at A Level, this is an extension of the use of
SQL to build and modify a database as well as using
SQL scripts to query an existing database.
AS and A Level covers relational databases that
consist of more than one table.

These are the data types used for attributes (fields)
in SQL.
Data Types
Description
for Attributes
CHAR(n)
Fixed length text n characters
VARCHAR(n)

Variable length text maximum n characters

Industry standard methods for building and
modifying a database

BOOLEAN

True or False SQL uses the integers 1 and 0

INTEGER

Whole number

Database Management Systems (DBMSs) use a Data
Definition Language (DDL) to create, modify and
remove the data structures that form a relational
database. DDL statements are written as a script that
uses syntax similar to a computer program.

REAL

Number with decimal places

DATE

A date usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD

TIME

A time usually formatted as HH:MM:SS

DBMSs also use a Data Manipulation Language (DML)
to add, modify, delete and retrieve the data stored in a
relational database. DML statements are written in a
script that is similar to a computer program.
These languages have different functions: DDL
is used for working on the relational database
structure, whereas DML is used to work with the data
stored in the relational database.
Most DBMSs use Structured Query Language (SQL)
for both data definition (DDL) and data manipulation
(DML). SQL was developed in the 1970s and since then
it has been adopted as an industry standard.
We have already covered some SQL commands
used to manipulate data. These are the SQL (DDL)
commands used to set up a database.

Extension Activity
Use SQL (DDL) commands to set up the
PATIENT database.
This SQL script could have been used to create the
Cub Scout database.
CREATE DATABASE CubScout
CREATE TABLE CUB(
CubName VARCHAR(30),
DateOfBirth DATE,
Address VARCHAR(40),
Gender CHAR(1),
School VARCHAR(30),

SQL (DDL) Command

Description

CREATE DATABASE

Creates a database

CREATE TABLE

Creates a table definition

ALTER Table

Alters a table definition

PRIMARY KEY

Adds a primary key to a table

TelephoneNumber, CHAR(14)
DateJoined DATE);
ALTER TABLE CUB ADD PRIMARY KEY
(CubNumber);

In this chapter, you have learnt about:
✔ define a single-table database from a given set of requirements
✔ suggest and use suitable data types for fields
✔ choose an appropriate primary key for a record
✔ understand SQL scripts used to query a single-table database.
