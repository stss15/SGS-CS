8.2 Arrays
An array is a data structure containing several elements of the same data type;
these elements can be accessed using the same identifier name. The position of
each element in an array is identified using the array’s index.

8.2.1 One- and Two-dimensional arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple data items in a uniformly accessible manner;
all the data items use the same identifier and each data item can be accessed
separately by the use of an index. In this way, lists of items can be stored,
searched and put into an order. For example, a list of names can be ordered
alphabetically, or a list of temperatures can be searched to find a particular
value.
The first element of an array can have an index of zero or one. However, most
programming languages automatically set the first index of an array to zero.
Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. One-dimensional and
two-dimensional arrays are included the IGCSE Computer Science syllabus.

8.2.2 Declaring and populating arrays with iteration
One-dimensional arrays
A one-dimensional array can be referred to as a list. Here is an example of a list
with 10 elements in it where the first element has an index of zero.

▲ Figure 8.10  A one-dimensional array

When a one-dimensional array is declared in pseudocode:
» the name of the array
» the first index value
» the last index value
» and the data type
are included.
For example, to declare a new array called MyList:
DECLARE MyList : ARRAY[0:9] OF INTEGER

Each position in the array can be populated in an array by defining the value
at each index position. For instance, we can add the number 27 to the fourth
position in the array MyList as follows:
MyList[4] ← 27

To populate the entire array instead we can use a loop:
OUTPUT "Enter these 10 values in order 27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72"
FOR Counter ← 0 TO 9
OUTPUT "Enter next value "
INPUT MyList[Counter]
NEXT Counter

Notice that in this code we have used the variable Counter as the array index.
We can display the data that lies in a particular location in an array as follows:
OUTPUT MyList[1]

This would display the value 19.

8.2 Arrays

Activity 8.22
In your chosen programming language write a short program to declare and
populate the array MyList, as shown in Figure 8.10, using a FOR loop.

Arrays can also be populated as they are declared.

Language

myList = [27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72]

Python

Dim myList = New Integer() {27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72}

Visual Basic

int[] myList = {27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 72};

Java

Two-dimensional arrays
A two-dimensional array can be referred to as a table, with rows and columns.
Here is an example of a table with 10 rows and 3 columns, which contains 30
elements. The first element is located at position 0,0.

The declared array can then be populated using a loop, just like for onedimensional arrays – however this time there need to be two nested loops, one
for each index:
OUTPUT "Enter these values in order 27, 19, 36, 42, 16, 89, 21, 16, 55, 34"
OUTPUT "Enter these values in order 31, 67, 98, 22, 35, 46, 71, 23, 11, 76"
OUTPUT "Enter these values in order 17, 48, 29, 95, 61, 47, 28, 13, 77, 21"
FOR ColumnCounter ← 0 TO 2
FOR RowCounter ← 0 TO 9
OUTPUT "Enter next value "
INPUT MyTable[RowCounter, ColumnCounter]
NEXT RowCounter
NEXT ColumnCounter

We can display the data that lies in a particular location in a two-dimensional
array as follows:
OUTPUT MyList[2,1]

This would display the value 98.

Advice
Notes on Python and arrays
Instead of arrays, Python uses another object called a list. The differences you
need to know are:
» a list can contain different data types whereas arrays must all hold the same
type of data
» to achieve the same structure as a two-dimensional array, Python embeds lists
within another.

Two-dimensional arrays are populated in each language as follows:
