8.3 File handling
8.3.1 Purpose of storing data in a file
Computer programs store data that will be required again in a file. While any
data stored in RAM will be lost when the computer is switched off, when data is
saved to a file it is stored permanently. Data stored in a file can thus be accessed
by the same program at a later date or accessed by another program. Data stored
in a file can also be sent to be used on other computer(s). The storage of data in
files is one of the most used features of programming.

8.3.2 Using files
Every file is identified by its filename. In this section, we are going to look at
how to read and write a line of text or a single item of data to a file.
Here are examples of writing a line of text to a file and reading the line of text
back from the file. The pseudocode algorithm has comments to explain each
stage of the task.

pseudocode
DECLARE TextLine : STRING

// variables are declared as normal

DECLARE MyFile : STRING
MyFile ← "MyText.txt"
// writing the line of text to the file
OPEN MyFile FOR WRITE

// opens file for writing

OUTPUT "Please enter a line of text"
INPUT TextLine
WRITEFILE, TextLine
CLOSEFILE(MyFile)

// writes a line of text to the file

// closes the file

// reading the line of text from the file
OUTPUT "The file contains this line of text:"
OPEN MyFile FOR READ
READFILE, TextLine

// opens file for reading
// reads a line of text from the file

OUTPUT TextLine
CLOSEFILE(MyFile)

// closes the file

Use the program written in your chosen programming language to write a line of
text to a file and read it back from the file. Use the comments in the pseudocode to
help you write comments to explain how the file handling works.

Activity 8.25
Using pseudocode write an algorithm to copy a line of text from one text file to
another text file.
In this chapter, you have learnt about:
✔ declare, use and identify appropriate data types for variables and constants
✔ understand and use input and outputs
✔ understand and use the programming concepts: sequence, selection, iteration,
totalling, counting and string handling
✔ understand and use nested statements
✔ understand and use arithmetic, logical and Boolean operators
✔ understand and use procedures, functions and library routines
✔ write maintainable programs
✔ declare, use, identify appropriate data types for, read and write arrays with one
and two dimensions
✔ store data in a file and retrieve data from a file.
Key terms used throughout this chapter
variable – a named data store that contains a value that
may change during the execution of a program
constant – a named data store that contains a value that
does not change during the execution of a program
declare – define the value and data type of a variable or constant
integer – a positive or negative whole number that can be
used with mathematical operators
real number – a positive or negative number with
a fractional part; Real numbers can be used with
mathematical operators
char – a variable or constant that is a single character
string – a variable or constant that is several characters
in length. Strings vary in length and may even have no
characters (an empty string); the characters can be letters
and/or digits and/or any other printable symbol
sequence – the order in which the steps in a program are
executed
selection – allowing the selection of different paths through
the steps of a program
iteration – a section of programming code that can be
repeated under certain conditions
counting – keeping track of the number of times an action
is performed
totalling – keeping a total that values are added to
operator – a special character or word in a programming
language that identifies an action to be performed
arithmetic operator – an operator that is used to perform
calculations
logical operator – an operator that is used to decide the
path to take through a program if the expression formed is
true or false

Boolean operator – an operator that is used with logical
operators to form more complex expressions
nesting – the inclusion of one type of code construct inside
another
procedure – a set of programming statements grouped
together under a single name that can be called to perform
a task in a program, rather than including a copy of the code
every time the task is performed
function – a set of programming statements grouped
together under a single name which can be called to
perform a task in a program, rather than including a copy of
the code every time; just like a procedure except a function
will return a value back to the main program
parameters – the variables in a procedure or function
declaration that store the values of the arguments passed
from the main program to a procedure or function
MOD – an arithmetic operator that returns the remainder
of a division; different languages use different symbols for
this operation
DIV – an arithmetic operator that returns the quotient
(whole number part) of a division; different languages use
different symbols for this operation
ROUND – a library routine that rounds a value to a given
number of decimal places
RANDOM – a library routine that generates a random
number
array – a data structure containing several elements of the
same data type; these elements can be accessed using the
same identifier name
index – identifies the position of an element in an array
file – a collection of data stored by a computer program to
be used again

Cambridge O Level Computer Science (0478) Paper 21 Q5, June 2017

For IGCSE Computer Science, you should be able to write an understandable
algorithm to solve a problem. Your algorithm should be easy to read and
understand and may use any of the concepts in this chapter and Chapter 7.
Here are some further problems for you to solve:
10 The one-dimensional array StaffName[] contains the names of the staff
in a department. Another one-dimensional array StaffPhone[] contains
the phone numbers for the members of staff. A final one-dimensional array
StaffOffice[] contains the office location for the members of staff.
The position of each member of staff’s data in the three arrays is the same,
for example, the member of staff in position 5 in StaffPhone[] and
StaffOffice[] is the same.
Write a program that meets the following requirements:
» uses procedures to display these lists:
– staff phone numbers and names in alphabetic order of staff name
– members of staff grouped by office number
» uses a procedure to display all the details for a member of staff, with the
name used as a parameter
» uses a procedure to update the details for a member of staff, with the
name used as a parameter.
You must use program code with local and global variables and add
comments to explain how your code works.
[15]
11 Use a trace table to test the program you have written in question 10.
[If you have used a real programming language to write your program then
it is also good practice to run the program to test and help find errors.][5]
12 You can become a member of the town guild if you meet all the following
requirements:
» aged between 18 and 65
» you have lived in the town for 20 years
or you have lived in the town for 5 years and both your parents still live in
the town
or one parent has died and the other parent still lives in the town
or you and a brother or a sister have lived in the town for 10 years
» you have half a million dollars in your bank account
» you have never been to prison
» at least two guild members support your application
» if five guild members support your application then you could be excused
one of the above requirements, apart from age
Write a program that allows you to input answers to questions to ensure that
you meet the requirements, issues a unique membership number if you do or
explains all the reasons for failure if you don’t meet the requirements.

13 Use a trace table to test the program you have written in question 12.
