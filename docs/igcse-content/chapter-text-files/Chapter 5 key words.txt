Key terms used throughout this chapter
internet – the world-wide interconnection of networks; the
internet makes use of TCP and IP protocols
World Wide Web – a massive collection of web pages and is
based on hypertext transfer protocols (http and https)
(web) browser – software that connects to a domain name
server (DNS) to locate IP addresses; a browser interprets
HTML web pages sent to a user’s computer so that the user
can read documents and watch multimedia
hypertext mark-up language (HTML) – the language used
to design, display and format web pages, and to write
http(s) protocols
uniform resource locator (URL) – a text-based address for
a web page
hypertext transfer protocol secure (https) – http with
extra security (such as SSL) applied
hyperlink – highlighted text or an image that is activated by
clicking and links to further text, images, a web page or a
website
domain name server (DNS) – a server that looks up domain
names for websites (for example, www.hoddereducation.
com) in order to find the IP addresses that a computer needs
to locate the web servers (for example, 107.162.140.19)
cookie – a text file sent from a website to a user’s browser;
it is used to remember user preferences each time they
visit the website
user preferences – settings or options stored in cookies
that can remember customised web pages or indicate
browsing history to target adverts
session cookie – a cookie that is stored temporarily on a
computer; it is deleted when the browser is closed or the
website session ends

persistent cookies – a cookie that is stored on the user’s
hard drive and only deleted when the expiry date is reached
or the cookie is deleted by the user
virtual shopping basket – an area of memory in a website
where items a user wishes to purchase are temporarily
stored; items remain in the basket until payment is made or
the session has ended
digital currency – currency (a system of money) that exists
in electronic form only; it has no physical form and is
essentially data on a database
cryptocurrency – a form of digital currency that uses a
chain of decentralised computers to control and monitor
transactions
cryptography – the protection of data/information by use of
coding; it usually involves encryption and decryption
blockchain – a decentralised database where all
transactions are stored; it consists of a number of
interconnected computers but not a central server
timestamp – a digital record of the date and time that a data
block is created in blockchain networks
proof-of-work – the algorithm used in blockchain networks
to confirm a transaction and to produce new blocks to add
to the chain; special users called miners complete and
monitor transactions on the network for a reward
brute force attack – a ‘trial and error’ method used by
cybercriminals to crack passwords by finding all possible
combinations of letters, numbers and symbols until the
password is found
word list – a text file containing a collection of words used
in a brute force attack
data interception – an attempt to eavesdrop on a wired or
wireless network transmission; cybercriminal often use

5.3 Cyber security

packet sniffing or access point mapping / wardriving to
intercept data
packet sniffing – a method used by a cybercriminal to
examine data packets being sent over a network and to find
the contents of a data packet, which are sent back to the
cybercriminal
wardriving – using a laptop, antenna, GPS device and
software to intercept Wi-Fi signals and illegally obtain data;
sometimes called Access Point Mapping
wired equivalency privacy (WEP) encryption protocol
security – an algorithm for wireless networks to protect
them against data interception
denial of service (DoS) attack – a cyberattack in which
cybercriminals seek to disrupt the normal operation of a
website by flooding it with requests; also used to clog up a
user’s mailbox by sending out thousands of spam emails
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack – a denial of
service (DoS) attack in which the fake requests come from
many different computers, which makes it harder to stop
spam – unsolicited emails sent to a user’s mailbox
hacking – the act of gaining illegal access to a computer
system without the owner’s permission
malware – programs (such as viruses, worms and Trojan
horses) installed on a user’s computer with the aim of
deleting, corrupting or manipulating data illegally
virus – a program or program code that replicates itself
with the intention of deleting or corrupting files or by
causing the computer system to malfunction
active host – functioning software that a virus can affect by
attaching itself to the code or by altering the code to allow
the virus to carry out its attack
worm – a stand-alone type of malware that can selfreplicate; unlike viruses, worms don’t need an active host;
they can spread throughout a network without the need for
any action by an end-user
Trojan horse – a type of malware that is designed to look
like legitimate software but contains malicious code that
can cause damage to a computer system
spyware – a type of malware that gathers information by
monitoring a user’s activities on a computer and sends the
gathered information back to the cybercriminal who sent
out the spyware
adware – a type of malware that attempts to flood the enduser with unwanted advertising
ransomware – a type of malware that encrypts data on
a user’s computer and ‘holds the data hostage’ until a
ransom is paid
phishing – sending out legitimate-looking emails designed
to trick the recipients into giving their personal details to
the sender of the email

spear phishing – similar to phishing but targeting specific
people or organisations rather than carrying out a blanket
attack
pharming – redirecting a user to a fake website in order to
illegally obtain personal data about the user without their
knowledge; unlike phishing, pharming is initiated without
needing any action by the user
DNS cache poisoning – altering IP addresses on a domain
name server (DNS) with the intention of redirecting a user’s
browser to a fake website; carried out by a pharmer (see
pharming) or hacker (see hacking)
social engineering – manipulating people into breaking
normal security procedures (such as giving away their
password) in order to gain illegal access to computer
systems or to place malware on their computer
access levels – different levels of access in a computer
system allowing a hierarchy of access levels depending on
user’s level of security
anti-spyware – software that detects and removes
spyware programs installed on a system; the software is
based on typical spyware rules or known file structures
authentication – the process of proving a user’s identity
by using something they know, something they have or
something unique to them
biometrics – type of authentication that uses a unique
human characteristic, such as fingerprints, voice or retina
blood vessel pattern
two-step verification – a type of authentication that requires
two methods of verification to prove the identity of a user
patch – an update for software that is developed to improve
the software and/or to remove any bugs
typo squatting – the use by cybercriminals of subtle
spelling errors in website addresses used to trick users
into visiting their fake websites
firewall – software or hardware that sits between a
computer and an external network (for example, the
internet); the firewall monitors and filters all incoming and
outgoing traffic
proxy server – a server that acts as an intermediary server
through which internet requests are processed; it often
makes use of cache memory to speed up web page access
privacy settings – controls available on social networking
and other websites which allow users to limit who can
access their profile or what they are allowed to see
secure sockets layer (SSL) – a security protocol used when
sending data over a network (such as the internet)
SSL certificate – a form of digital certificate which is used
to authenticate a website; providing the SSL certificate can
be authenticated, any communication or data exchange
between browser and website is secure
