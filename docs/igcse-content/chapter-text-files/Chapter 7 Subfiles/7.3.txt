7.3 Explaining the purpose of an algorithm
An algorithm sets out the steps to complete a given task. This is usually shown
as a flowchart or pseudocode, so that the purpose of the task and the processes
needed to complete it are clear to those who study it.
You will be able to practise this skill as you become more familiar with writing
and finding and correcting errors in algorithms.

Example 1: Output an alarm sound
The purpose of the following pseudocode is to output the alarm sound at the
appropriate time. The processes are: waiting 10 seconds, getting the current time,
checking the current time with the alarm time, and outputting the alarm sound when
the times match.
REPEAT

Waits for 10
seconds

Wait (10)
Get (Time)

Get current time from
the system clock

UNTIL Time = Alarm _ Time
OUTPUT AlarmSound

Activity 7.6
Have a look at the flowchart and pseudocode below:
» identify the purpose of the algorithm that they both represent
» identify the processes included in the algorithm.
What would be output if the numbers 7 and 18 were input?
START

INPUT
Num1, Num2

INPUT Num1, Num2
IF Num1 > Num2
Num1 >
Num2?

yes

PRINT Num1,
" is largest"

no

THEN PRINT NUM1, " is largest"
ELSE PRINT NUM2, " is largest"
ENDIF

PRINT Num2,
" is largest"

STOP
