7.5 Validation and verification
In order for computer systems to only accept data inputs that are reasonable and
accurate, every item of data needs to be examined before it is accepted by the
system.
Two different methods, with very similar sounding names, are used. For
data entry, validation ensures that only data that is reasonable is accepted.
Verification is used to check that the data does not change as it is being
entered.

7.5.1 Validation
Validation is the automated checking by a program that data is reasonable
before it is accepted into a computer system. When data is validated by a
computer system, if the data is rejected a message should be output explaining
why the data was rejected and another opportunity given to enter the data.
There are many different types of validation checks including:
» range checks
» length checks
» type checks
» presence checks
» format checks
» check digits.

7.5 Validation and verification

Different types of check may be used on the same piece of data; for example, an
examination mark could be checked for reasonableness by using a range check, a
type check and a presence check.

Range check
A range check checks that the value of a number is between an upper value and
a lower value. For example, checking that percentage marks are between 0 and
100 inclusive:
OUTPUT "Please enter the student's mark "
REPEAT
INPUT StudentMark
IF StudentMark < 0 OR StudentMark > 100
THEN
OUTPUT "The student's mark should be in the range
0 to 100, please re-enter the mark "
ENDIF
UNTIL StudentMark >= 0 AND StudentMark <= 100

Length check
A length check checks either:
» that data contains an exact number of characters, for example that a password
must be exactly eight characters in length so that passwords with seven or
fewer characters or nine or more characters would be rejected, for instance:
Password has a
data type of string
and LENGTH is
the pseudocode
operation that
returns a whole
number showing
the number of
characters in the
string

OUTPUT "Please enter your password of eight
characters "
REPEAT
INPUT Password
IF LENGTH(Password) <> 8
THEN
OUTPUT "Your password must be exactly eight
    characters, please re-enter "
ENDIF
UNTIL LENGTH(Password) = 8

» or that the data entered is a reasonable number of characters, for example,
a family name could be between two and thirty characters inclusive so that
names with one character or thirty-one or more characters would be rejected.

in the string

OUTPUT "Please enter your family name "
REPEAT
INPUT FamilyName
IF LENGTH(FamilyName) > 30 OR LENGTH(FamilyName) < 2
THEN
OUTPUT "Too short or too long,
please re-enter "
ENDIF
UNTIL LENGTH(FamilyName) <= 30 AND LENGTH(FamilyName) >= 2

of the concepts and
commands in this
code, such as DIV,
see Chapter 8.

Type check
A type check checks that the data entered is of a given data type, for example,
that the number of brothers or sisters would be an integer (whole number).
OUTPUT "How many brothers do you have? "
REPEAT
INPUT NumberOfBrothers

Programming is
covered in Chapter 8.
When you have started
your programming,
find out how you
could test for a whole
number and write and
test a program for this
validation rule.

IF NumberOfBrothers <> DIV(NumberOfBrothers, 1)
THEN
OUTPUT "This must be a whole number, please re-enter"
ENDIF
UNTIL NumberOfBrothers = DIV(NumberOfBrothers, 1)

Presence check
A presence check checks to ensure that some data has been entered and the
value has not been left blank, for example, an email address for an online
transaction must be completed.
OUTPUT "Please enter your email address "
REPEAT
INPUT EmailAddress
IF EmailAddress = ""
THEN
OUTPUT "*=Required "
ENDIF
UNTIL EmailAddress <> ""

Format check and check digit
A format check checks that the characters entered conform to a pre-defined
pattern, for example, in Chapter 9 the cub number must be in the form CUB9999.
The pseudocode for this example will be given in the string handling section of
Chapter 9.

check digit
calculations are
covered in Chapter 2.

A check digit is the final digit included in a code; it is calculated from all the
other digits in the code. Check digits are used for barcodes, product codes,
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) and Vehicle Identification Numbers
(VIN).
Check digits are used to identify errors in data entry caused by mis-typing or
mis-scanning a barcode. They can usually detect the following types of error:
» an incorrect digit entered, for example, 5327 entered instead of 5307
» transposition errors where two numbers have changed order for example 5037
instead of 5307
» omitted or extra digits, for example, 537 instead of 5307 or 53107 instead of
5307
» phonetic errors, for example, 13, thirteen, instead of 30, thirty.
