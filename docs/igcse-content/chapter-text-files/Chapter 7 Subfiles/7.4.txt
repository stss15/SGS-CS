7.4 Standard methods of solution
The ability to repeat existing methods is very important in the design of
algorithms; when an algorithm is turned into a program the same methods may
be repeated many thousands of times.
You need to be able to use and understand these standard methods used in
algorithms:
» Totalling
» Counting
» Finding maximum, minimum, and average (mean) values
» Searching using a linear search
» Sorting using a bubble sort.
All the standard methods of solution are shown as pseudocode algorithms and
will be used to practise program writing in the next chapter.

7.4.1 Totalling
Totalling means keeping a total that values are added to. For example, keeping a
running total of the marks awarded to each student in a class.
Total ← 0
FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize
Total ← Total + StudentMark[Counter]
NEXT Counter

Initialising
Total to zero

Totalling the marks
in an array called
StudentMark

7.4.2 Counting
Keeping a count of the number of times an action is performed is another
standard method. For example, counting the number of students that were
awarded a pass mark:
PassCount ← 0
FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize
INPUT StudentMark

Initialising
PassCount to
zero

IF StudentMark > 50

THEN
PassCount ← PassCount + 1
NEXT Counter

Counting the
number of passes

Count ← Count + 1

7.4 Standard methods of solution

Counting is also used to count down until a certain value is reached, for example,
checking the number of items in stock in a supermarket:
:
NumberInStock ← NumberInStock - 1
IF NumberInStock < 20

Counting down
items in stock

THEN
CALL Reorder()
:

7.4.3 Maximum, minimum and average

Initialising
maximum to the
lowest mark
possible

Finding the largest and smallest values in a list are two standard methods that
are frequently found in algorithms, for example, finding the highest and lowest
mark awarded to a class of students.
MaximumMark ← 0
MinimumMark ← 100
FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize

Calls data from an
array (see Chapter 8)
called StudentMark)

Initialising
minimum to the
highest possible

IF StudentMark[Counter] > MaximumMark
THEN
MaximumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
IF StudentMark[Counter] < MinimumMark

Replacing the
maximum mark
with a higher mark

THEN
MinimumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
NEXT Counter

Replacing the
minimum mark
with a lower mark

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

If the largest and smallest values are not known, an alternative method is to set
the maximum and minimum values to the first item in the list.
For example, using this method to find the highest and lowest mark awarded to a
class of students.
MaximumMark ← StudentMark[1]
MinimumMark ← StudentMark[1]
FOR Counter ← 2 TO ClassSize
Starting the loop at
the second position in
the list.

Initialising minimum
and maximum to the
first mark

IF StudentMark[Counter] > MaximumMark
THEN
MaximumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
IF StudentMark[Counter] < MinimumMark
THEN
MinimumMark ← StudentMark[Counter]
ENDIF
NEXT Counter

Calculating the average (mean) of all the values in a list is an extension of the
totalling method, for example, calculating the average mark for a class of students.
Total ← 0
FOR Counter ← 1 TO ClassSize
Total ← Total + StudentMark[Counter]
NEXT Counter
Average ← Total / ClassSize

Calculating the
average from the total
after the loop has
been completed

7.4.4 Linear search
A search is used to check if a value is stored in a list, performed by
systematically working through the items in the list. There are several standard
search methods, but you only need to understand one method for IGCSE Computer
Science. This is called a linear search, which inspects each item in a list in turn
to see if the item matches the value searched for.
For example, searching for a name in a class list of student names, where all the
names stored are different:
OUTPUT "Please enter name to find "
INPUT Name
Found ← FALSE

Setting a variable,
Found, as a flag, using
TRUE and FALSE to
indicate if the name
has been found or not

Counter ← 1
REPEAT
IF Name = StudentName[Counter]

Checking if the name
input matches a name
in the list

7.4 Standard methods of solution

THEN
Found ← TRUE
ELSE

Setting the flag to
TRUE when a match
is found

Counter ← Counter + 1
ENDIF
UNTIL Found OR Counter > ClassSize
IF Found
Outputting the
position in the list
when a match is
found

THEN

Stopping the search
when a match is
found or the whole
list has been searched

OUTPUT Name, " found at position ",
Counter, " in the list."
ELSE
OUTPUT Name, " not found."
ENDIF

In this example, the search checks how many people chose ice cream as their
favourite dessert, where several values in the list can be the same.
ChoiceCount ← 0
FOR Counter ← 1 TO Length
IF "ice cream" = Dessert[Counter]

Checking ice cream
has been chosen

THEN
ChoiceCount ← ChoiceCount + 1
NEXT Counter

Checking every item
in the list

OUTPUT ChoiceCount, " chose ice cream
as their favourite dessert."

7.4.5 Bubble sort
Lists can be more useful if the items are sorted in a meaningful order. For
example, names could be sorted in alphabetical order, or temperatures could
be sorted in ascending or descending order. There are several standard sorting
methods available, but you only need to understand one method for IGCSE
Computer Science.
This method of sorting is called a bubble sort. Each element is compared with
the next element and swapped if the elements are in the wrong order, starting
from the first element and finishing with next-to-last element. Once it reaches
the end of the list, we can be sure that the last element is now in the correct
place. However, other items in the list may still be out of order. Each element
in the list is compared again apart from the last one because we know the final
element is in the correct place. This continues to repeat until there is only one
element left to check or no swaps are made.

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

For example, the bubble sort algorithm can be used to sort a list of ten
temperatures stored in the array, Temperature[], into ascending order. It
could be written in pseudocode as:
First ← 1
Last ← 10
REPEAT
Swap ← FALSE
FOR Index ← First TO Last - 1
The IF..THEN
condition checks
if temperatures
are in ascending
order and swaps
them if they are
not, using the Temp
variable (short for
temporary)

IF Temperature[Index] > temperature[Index + 1]
THEN
Temp ← Temperature[Index]
Temperature[Index] ← Temperature[Index + 1]
Temperature[Index + 1] ← Temp
Swap ← TRUE
ENDIF
NEXT Index
Last ← Last - 1
UNTIL (NOT Swap) OR Last = 1
