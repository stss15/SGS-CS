1 Find an ISBN, then show that its check digit is correct.
Working in pairs find two ISBNs each, copy one down with a transposition error and
the other one correctly.
Swap your ISBNs and see if you can find the one with the error.
Look at a correct ISBN, can you think of an error that this system will not identify
and explain with an example why this is the case?
2 Find out how limit checks and consistency checks are used.

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

Activity 7.7
1 State, with reasons, which validation checks you could use for the following
inputs.
You may decide that more than one validation check is required.
– Entering a telephone number
– Entering a pupil’s name
– Entering a part number in the form XXX999, when X must be a letter and 9
must be a digit.
2 Write an algorithm using pseudocode to check the age and height of a child
who wants to go on a fairground ride. The age must be over 7 and under 12, the
height must be over 110 centimetres and under 150 centimetres.
3 Write an algorithm using pseudocode to check that the length of a password is
between 8 and 12 characters inclusive.

7.5.2 Verification
Verification is checking that data has been accurately copied from one source to
another – for instance, input into a computer or transferred from one part of a
computer system to another.
Verification methods for input data include:
» Double entry
» Screen/visual check.
For double entry the data is entered twice, sometimes by different operators.
The computer system compares both entries and if they are different outputs an
error message requesting that the data is entered again.

Link
Parity checks and
checksums are
used when data is
transferred from one
part of a computer
system to another,
or across a network,
and are discussed in
Chapter 2.

▲ Figure 7.14 Double entry

A screen/visual check is a manual check completed by the user who is entering
the data. When the data entry is complete the data is displayed on the screen
and the user is asked to confirm that it is correct before continuing. The user
either checks the data on the screen against a paper document that is being
used as an input form or, confirms whether it is correct from their own
knowledge.

7.6 Test data

Activity 7.8
Explain why the following input data also needs to be verified:
» Entering a telephone number
» Entering a pupil’s name
» Entering a part number in the form XXX999, when X must be a letter and
9 must be a digit.
