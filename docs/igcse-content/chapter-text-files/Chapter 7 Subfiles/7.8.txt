7.8 Identifying errors in algorithms
Trace tables and test data can be used to identify and correct errors.
Your completed trace table for Activity 7.14 should look like this:

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

Activity 7.15
Use a trace table and some negative test data to record another dry run of the
pseudocode or flowchart. What error have you found?

As this algorithm only works for numbers between 0 and 100; a better algorithm
could look like this:
START

A ← 0
B ← -1000000
C ← 1000000

INPUT X

X > B?

yes

B ← X

yes

C ← X

no

X < C?
no
A < A + 1

yes

A < 10?

no
OUTPUT B, C

STOP

▲ Figure 7.16 A better algorithm

This algorithm is very similar and works for a much larger range of numbers, but
it still does not work for every set of numbers.

Activity 7.16
Identify two numbers where the algorithm will still fail.

7.8 Identifying errors in algorithms

In order to work for any set of numbers, the algorithm needs to be re-written to
allow the largest and smallest numbers to be tested against numbers that appear
in any list provided. The provisional values set at the start of the algorithm need
to be chosen from the list. A standard method is to set both these provisional
values to the value of the first item input.
START

A ← 0

INPUT X

B and C set to the
first value input.

B ← X
C ← X

INPUT X

X > B?

yes

B ← X

yes

C ← X

no

X < C?
no
A ← A + 1

yes

The counter A is
now tested for 9
instead of 10.

A < 9?

no
OUTPUT B, C

STOP

7 Algorithm design and problem solving

Activity 7.17
Rewrite the pseudocode so it works for every set of numbers like the flowchart above.
Test your pseudocode algorithm with this set of test data:
-97, 12390, 0, 77, 359, -2, -89, 5000, 21, 67
