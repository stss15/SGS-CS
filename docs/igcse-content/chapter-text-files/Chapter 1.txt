– the denary, binary and hexadecimal number systems
– converting numbers between denary, binary and hexadecimal
– how and why hexadecimal is used for data representation
– how to add two positive 8-bit numbers
– overflow when performing binary addition
– logical binary shifts on positive 8-bit integers
– two’s complement notation to represent positive and negative binary numbers
★ text, sound and images
– how and why a computer represents text
– the use of character sets including ASCII and Unicode
– how and why a computer represents sound
– sound sample rate and sample resolution

This chapter considers the three key number systems used in computer
science, namely binary, denary and hexadecimal. It also discusses
how these number systems are used to measure the size of computer
memories and storage devices, together with how sound and images can
be represented digitally.

1.1 Number systems
1.1.1 Binary represents data
As you progress through this book you will begin to realise how complex
computer systems really are. By the time you reach Chapter 10 you should have a
better understanding of the fundamentals behind computers themselves and the
software that controls them.
You will learn that any form of data needs to be converted into a binary format
so that it can be processed by the computer.
However, no matter how complex the system, the basic building block in all
computers is the binary number system. This system is chosen because it only
consists of 1s and 0s. Since computers contain millions and millions of tiny
‘switches’, which must be in the ON or OFF position, they can be represented by
the binary system. A switch in the ON position is represented by 1; a switch in
the OFF position is represented by 0.

1.1 Number systems

Switches used in a computer make use of logic gates (see Chapter 10) and are
used to store and process data.

1.1.2 Binary, denary and hexadecimal systems
The binary system
We are all familiar with the denary number system which counts in multiples of 10.
This gives us the well-known headings of units, 10s, 100s, 1000s, and so on:
(104)

(103)

(102)

(101)

(100)

10 000

Denary uses ten separate digits, 0-9, to represent all values. Denary is known as
a base 10 number system.
The binary number system is a base 2 number system. It is based on the number 2.
Thus, only the two ‘values’ 0 and 1 can be used in this system to represent all
values. Using the same method as denary, this gives the headings 20, 21, 22, 23,
and so on. The typical headings for a binary number with eight digits would be:
(27)

(26)

A typical binary number would be: 11101110.

Converting from binary to denary
The conversion from binary to denary is a relatively straightforward process. Each
time a 1-value appears in a binary number column, the column value (heading)
is added to a total. This is best shown by three examples which use 8-bit, 12-bit
and 16-bit binary numbers:

Example 1
Convert the binary number, 11101110, into a denary number.

The equivalent denary number is 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 238

As with the two examples above, to convert this number to denary, each time a 1
appears in a column the column value is added to the total:
8192 + 4096 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 2 = 12 774
The same method can be used for a binary number of any size.

Converting from denary to binary
The conversion from denary numbers to binary numbers can be done in two
different ways. The first method involves successive subtraction of powers of 2
(that is, 128, 64, 32, 16, and so on); whilst the second method involves successive
division by 2 until the value “0” is reached. This is best shown by two examples:

Example 1
Consider the conversion of the denary number, 142, into binary:

Method 1
The denary number 142 is made up of 128 + 8 + 4 + 2 (that is, 142 – 128 = 14; 14 – 8 = 6;
6 – 4 = 2; 2 – 2 = 0; in each stage, subtract the largest possible power of 2 and keep
doing this until the value 0 is reached. This will give us the following 8-bit binary
number:

Method 2
This method involves successive division by 2. Start with the denary number, 142, and
divide it by 2. Write the result of the division including the remainder (even if it is 0)
under the 142 (that is, 142 ÷ 2 = 71 remainder 0); then divide again by 2 (that is,
71 ÷ 2 = 35 remainder 1) and keep dividing until the result is zero. Finally write down
all the remainders in reverse order:

We end up with an 8-bit binary number which is the same as that found by Method 1.

Example 2
Consider the conversion of the denary number, 59, into binary:

Method 1
The denary number 59 is made up of 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 (that is, 59 – 32 = 27; 27 – 16 = 11;
11 – 8 = 3; 3 – 2 = 1; 1 – 1 = 0; in each stage, subtract the largest possible power of 2
and keep doing this until the value 0 is reached. This will give us the following 8-bit

1 Data representation
If we want to show this as an 8-bit binary number (as shown in Method 1), we now
simply add two 0’s from the left-hand side to give the result: 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1. The two
results from both methods clearly agree.
Both the above examples use 8-bit binary numbers. This third example shows how
the method can still be used for any size of binary number; in this case a 16-bit binary
number.

Example 3
Consider the conversion of the denary number, 35 000, into a 16-bit binary number:

Method 1
The denary number 35 000 is made up of 32 768 + 2048 + 128 + 32 + 16 + 8 (that is,
35 000 – 32 768 = 2232; 2232 – 2048 = 184; 184 – 128 = 56; 56 – 32 = 24; 24 – 16 = 8;
8 – 8 = 0; in each stage, subtract the largest possible power of 2 and keep doing this
until the value 0 is reached. This will give us the following 16-bit binary number:

under the 35 000 (that is, 35 000 ÷ 2 = 17 500 remainder 0); then divide again by 2 (that
is, 17 500 ÷ 2 = 8750 remainder 0) and keep dividing until the result is zero. Finally write

The hexadecimal system
The hexadecimal number system is very closely related to the binary system.
Hexadecimal (sometimes referred to as simply ‘hex’) is a base 16 system and
therefore needs to use 16 different ‘digits’ to represent each value.
Because it is a system based on 16 different digits, the numbers 0 to 9 and the
letters A to F are used to represent each hexadecimal (hex) digit. A in hex = 10
in denary, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14 and F = 15.
Using the same method as for denary and binary, this gives the headings 160,
161, 162, 163, and so on. The typical headings for a hexadecimal number with five
digits would be:
(164)

(163)

(162)

(161)

(160)

65 536

4096

256

16

F

A

A typical example of hex is 2 1 F 3 A.
Since 16 = 24 this means that FOUR binary digits are equivalent to each
hexadecimal digit. The following table summarises the link between binary,
hexadecimal and denary:

1 Data representation

Converting from binary to hexadecimal and from hexadecimal
to binary
Converting from binary to hexadecimal is a fairly easy process. Starting from the
right and moving left, split the binary number into groups of 4 bits. If the last
group has less than 4 bits, then simply fill in with 0s from the left. Take each
group of 4 bits and convert it into the equivalent hexadecimal digit using Table
1.1. Look at the following two examples to see how this works.

Example 1
101111100001
First split this up into groups of 4 bits:

1011

1110

0001

Then, using Table 1.1, find the equivalent hexadecimal digits:

B

E

Example 2
10000111111101
First split this up into groups of 4 bits:

1111

1101

The left group only contains 2 bits, so add in two 0s:

Now use Table 1.1 to find the equivalent hexadecimal digits:

c 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

j 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0

Converting from hexadecimal to binary is also very straightforward. Using the
data in Table 1.1, simply take each hexadecimal digit and write down the 4-bit
code which corresponds to the digit.

Using Table 1.1, find the 4 bit code for each digit:

Converting from hexadecimal to denary and from denary
to hexadecimal
To convert hexadecimal numbers into denary involves the value headings of each
hexadecimal digit; that is, 4096, 256, 16 and 1.
Take each of the hexadecimal digits and multiply it by the heading values. Add
all the resultant totals together to give the denary number. Remember that
the hex digits A → F need to be first converted to the values 10 → 15 before
carrying out the multiplication. This is best shown by two examples:

Example 1
Convert the hexadecimal number, 4 5 A, into denary.
First of all we have to multiply each hex digit by its heading value:
256
4

16
5

1
A

(4 × 256 = 1024) (5 × 16 = 80) (10 × 1 = 10)

(NOTE: A = 10)

Then we have to add the three totals together (1024 + 80 + 10) to give the denary
number:

1 1 1 4

Example 2
Convert the hexadecimal number, C 8 F, into denary.
First of all we have to multiply each hex digit by its heading value:
256

F

(12 × 256 = 3072) (8 × 16 = 128) (15 × 1 = 15)

(NOTE: C = 12, F = 15)

Then we have to add the three totals together (3072 + 128 + 15) to give the denary
number:

To convert from denary to hexadecimal involves successive division by 16 until
the value “0” is reached. This is best shown by two examples:

Example 1
Convert the denary number, 2004, into hexadecimal.
This method involves successive division by 16 until the value 0 is reached. We start
by dividing the number 2004 by 16. The result of the division including the remainder
(even if it is 0) is written under 2004 and then further divisions by 16 are carried out
(that is, 2004 ÷ 16 = 125 remainder 4; 125 ÷ 16 = 7 remainder 13; 7 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 7).
The hexadecimal number is obtained from the remainders written in reverse order:

carried out (that is, 8463 ÷ 16 = 528 remainder 15; 528 ÷ 16 = 33 remainder 0; 33 ÷ 16 = 2
remainder 1; 2 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 2). The hexadecimal number is obtained from the

1.1.3 Use of the hexadecimal system
As we have seen, a computer can only work with binary data. Whilst computer
scientists can work with binary, they find hexadecimal to be more convenient
to use. This is because one hex digit represents four binary digits. A complex
binary number, such as 1101001010101111 can be written in hex as D2AF. The hex
number is far easier for humans to remember, copy and work with. This section
reviews four uses of the hexadecimal system:
» error codes
» MAC addresses
» IPv6 addresses
» HTML colour codes
The information in this section gives the reader sufficient grounding in each
topic at this level. Further material can be found by searching the internet, but
be careful that you don’t go off at a tangent.

Error codes
Error codes are often shown as hexadecimal values. These numbers refer to the
memory location of the error and are usually automatically generated by the
computer. The programmer needs to know how to interpret the hexadecimal error
codes. Examples of error codes from a Windows system are shown below:

Media Access Control (MAC) addresses
Media Access Control (MAC) address refers to a number which uniquely identifies
a device on a network. The MAC address refers to the network interface card (NIC)
which is part of the device. The MAC address is rarely changed so that a particular
device can always be identified no matter where it is.
A MAC address is usually made up of 48 bits which are shown as 6 groups of two
hexadecimal digits (although 64-bit addresses also exist):
NN – NN – NN – DD – DD – DD

or
NN:NN:NN:DD:DD:DD

where the first half (NN – NN – NN) is the identity number of the manufacturer of
the device and the second half (DD – DD – DD) is the serial number of the device.
For example:

Refer to Chapter 3
for more detail on IP
addresses.

00 – 1C – B3 – 4F – 25 – FE is the MAC address of a device produced by the Apple
Corporation (code: 001CB3) with a serial number of: 4F25FE. Very often lowercase
hexadecimal letters are used in the MAC address: 00-1c-b3-4f-25-fe. Other
manufacturer identification numbers include:
00 – 14 – 22 which identifies devices made by Dell
00 – 40 – 96 which identifies devices made by Cisco
00 – a0 – c9 which identifies devices made by Intel, and so on.

Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
Each device connected to a network is given an address known as the Internet
Protocol (IP) address. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number written in denary or
hexadecimal form: e.g. 109.108.158.1 (or 77.76.9e.01 in hex). IPv4 has recently
been improved upon by the adoption of IPv6. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit
number broken down into 16-bit chunks, represented by a hexadecimal number.
For example:
a8fb:7a88:fff0:0fff:3d21:2085:66fb:f0fa

Note IPv6 uses a colon (:) rather than a decimal point (.) as used in IPv4.

HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) colour codes
HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) is used when writing and developing web
pages. HTML isn’t a programming language but is simply a mark-up language. A
mark-up language is used in the processing, definition and presentation of text
(for example, specifying the colour of the text).
HTML uses <tags> which are used to bracket a piece of text for example, <h1>
and </h1> surround a top-level heading. Whatever is between the two tags has
been defined as heading level 1. Here is a short example of HTML code:

<h2 style="color:#00FF00;">This is a green heading</h2>
<h3 style="color:#0000FF;">This is a blue heading</h3>
▲ Figure 1.4

HTML is often used to represent colours of text on the computer screen. All
colours can be made up of different combinations of the three primary colours
(red, green and blue). The different intensity of each colour (red, green and blue)
is determined by its hexadecimal value. This means different hexadecimal values
represent different colours. For example:
» # FF 00 00 represents primary colour red
» # 00 FF 00 represents primary colour green
» # 00 00 FF represents primary colour blue
» # FF 00 FF represents fuchsia
» # FF 80 00 represents orange
» # B1 89 04 represents a tan colour,
and so on producing almost any colour the user wants. The following diagrams
show the various colours that can be selected by altering the hex ‘intensity’ of
red, green and blue primary colours. The colour ‘FF9966’ has been chosen as an
example:

FF
99
66
▲ Figure 1.5 Examples of HTML hex colour codes

The # symbol always precedes hexadecimal values in HTML code. The colour codes
are always six hexadecimal digits representing the red, green and blue components.
There are a possible 256 values for red, 256 values for green and 256 values for
blue giving a total of 256 × 256 × 256 (i.e. 16 777 216) possible colours.

For comparison: if we add 7 and 9
in denary the result is: carry = 1
and sum = 6; if we add 7, 9 and
8 the result is: carry = 2 and sum
= 4, and so on.

Advice
Here’s a quick recap on the role of carry and sum. If we want to add the numbers 97
and 64 in decimal, we:
l add the numbers in the right hand column first
l if the sum is greater than 9 then we carry a value to the next column
l we continue moving left, adding any carry values to each column until we are finished.
For instance:
   9 7
+ 64
1 1 CARRY VALUES
1 6 1 SUM VALUES
Adding in binary follows the same rules except that we carry whenever the sum is
greater than 1.

carry
sum

This addition has generated a 9th bit. The 8 bits of the answer are 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 – this
gives the denary value (64 + 8 + 4) of 76 which is incorrect because the denary value of
the addition is 110 + 222 = 332.
The maximum denary value of an 8-bit binary number is 255 (which is 28 – 1). The
generation of a 9th bit is a clear indication that the sum has exceeded this value. This
is known as an overflow error and in this case is an indication that a number is too
big to be stored in the computer using 8 bits.
The greater the number of bits which can be used to represent a number then the
larger the number that can be stored. For example, a 16-bit register would allow a
maximum denary value of 65 535 (i.e. 216 – 1) to be stored, a 32-bit register would
allow a maximum denary value of 4 294 967 295 (i.e. 232 – 1), and so on.

Activity 1.10
1 Convert the following pairs of denary numbers to 8-bit binary numbers and
then add the binary numbers. Comment on your answers in each case:
a 89 + 175
b 168 + 99
c 88 + 215
2 Carry out the following 16-bit binary additions and comment on your answers:

b 1110 1110 0000 1011 + 1111 1101 1101 1001

1.1.5 Logical binary shifts
Computers can carry out a logical shift on a sequence of binary numbers. The
logical shift means moving the binary number to the left or to the right. Each
shift left is equivalent to multiplying the binary number by 2 and each shift
right is equivalent to dividing the binary number by 2.
As bits are shifted, any empty positions are replaced with a zero – see examples
below. There is clearly a limit to the number of shifts which can be carried out
if the binary number is stored in an 8-bit register. Eventually after a number of
shifts the register would only contain zeros. For example, if we shift 01110000
(denary value 112) five places left (the equivalent to multiplying by 25, i.e. 32), in
an 8-bit register we would end up with 00000000. This makes it seem as though
112 × 32 = 0! This would result in the generation of an error message.

The value of the binary bits is now 21 × 21 i.e. 42. We can see this is correct if we
calculate the denary value of the new binary number 101010 (i.e. 32 + 8 + 2).

Suppose we now shift the original number two places left:

The value of the binary bits is now 200 ÷ 21 i.e. 100. We can see this is correct by

In d the result of the right shift gives a value of 4, which is incorrect since
36 ÷ 23 is not 4; therefore, the number of possible right shifts has been exceeded. You
can also see that a 1 has been lost from the original binary number, which is another
sign that there have been too many right shifts.

1.1.6 Two’s complement (binary numbers)
Up until now, we have assumed all binary numbers are positive integers. To
allow the possibility of representing negative integers we make use of two’s
complement. In this section we will again assume 8-bit registers are being used.
Only one minor change to the binary headings needs to be introduced here:
–128

18/02/21 3:22 PM

1.1 Number systems

In two’s complement the left-most bit is changed to a negative value. For
instance, for an 8-bit number, the value 128 is now changed to −128, but all the
other headings remain the same. This means the new range of possible numbers
is: −128 (10000000) to +127 (01111111).
It is important to realise when applying two’s complement to a binary number
that the left-most bit always determines the sign of the binary number. A 1-value
in the left-most bit indicates a negative number and a 0-value in the leftmost bit indicates a positive number (for example, 00110011 represents 51 and
11001111 represents −49).

Writing positive binary numbers in two’s complement format

Example 1
The following two examples show how we can write the following positive binary
numbers in the two’s complement format 19 and 4:

As you will notice, for positive binary numbers, it is no different to what was
done in Section 1.1.2.

Converting positive denary numbers to binary numbers in the two’s
complement format
If we wish to convert a positive denary number to the two’s complement format,
we do exactly the same as in Section 1.1.2:

Example 2
Convert a 38 b 125 to 8-bit binary numbers using the two’s complement format.
a Since this number is positive, we must have a zero in the –128 column. It is then a
simple case of putting 1-values into their correct positions to make up the value
of 38:

b Again, since this is a positive number, we must have a zero in the –128 column. As in

of 125:

32 + 16 + 8 + 4 +2 + 1 = 63.

1.1 Number systems

Writing negative binary numbers in two’s complement format and
converting to denary

Example 1
The following three examples show how we can write negative binary numbers in the
two’s complement format:

By following our normal rules, each time a 1 appears in a column, the column value is
added to the total. So, we can see that in denary this is: −128 + 16 + 2 + 1 = −109.

Similarly, in denary this number is −128 + 64 + 32 + 4 = −28.

This number is equivalent to −128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 1 = −11.

Note that a two’s complement number with a 1-value in the −128 column must
represent a negative binary number.

Converting negative denary numbers into binary numbers in two’s
complement format
Consider the number +67 in 8-bit (two’s complement) binary format:

Method 1
Now let’s consider the number −67. One method of finding the binary equivalent
to −67 is to simply put 1s in their correct places:

−128 + 32 + 16 + 8

+ 4 + 1 = −67

Method 2
However, looking at the two binary numbers above, there is another possible way
to find the binary representation of a negative denary number:
first write the number as a positive binary value – in this case 67:

01000011

we then invert each binary value, which means swap the 1s and 0s around:

10111100

then add 1 to that number:
this gives us the binary for −67:

10111101

Example 2
Convert −79 into an 8-bit binary number using two’s complement format.

Method 1
As it is a negative number, we need a 1-value in the −128 column.
−79 is the same as −128 + 49
We can make up 49 from 32 + 16 + 1; giving:
−128

Method 2

add 1 to the inverted number

thus giving −79:

1.2.1 Character sets – ASCII code and Unicode
The ASCII code system (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
was set up in 1963 for use in communication systems and computer systems.
A newer version of the code was published in 1986. The standard ASCII
code character set consists of 7-bit codes (0 to 127 in denary or 00 to 7F in

The above examples show that the sixth bit changes from 1 to 0 when comparing
the lowercase and uppercase of a character. This makes the conversion between
the two an easy operation. It is also noticeable that the character sets (e.g. a to
z, 0 to 9, etc.) are grouped together in sequence, which speeds up usability.
Extended ASCII uses 8-bit codes (0 to 255 in denary or 0 to FF in hexadecimal).
This gives another 128 codes to allow for characters in non-English alphabets and
for some graphical characters to be included:

1 Data representation

ASCII code has a number of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that it
does not represent characters in non-Western languages, for example Chinese
characters. As can be seen in Figure 1.6 where DOS and Windows use different
characters for some ASCII codes. For this reason, different methods of coding
have been developed over the years. One coding system is called Unicode.
Unicode can represent all languages of the world, thus supporting many
operating systems, search engines and internet browsers used globally. There is
overlap with standard ASCII code, since the first 128 (English) characters are the
same, but Unicode can support several thousand different characters in total.
As can be seen in Table 1.2 and Figure 1.6, ASCII uses one byte to represent a
character, whereas Unicode will support up to four bytes per character.
The Unicode consortium was set up in 1991. Version 1.0 was published with five
goals; these were to:

Find out more
DOS appears in the
ASCII extended code
table. Find out what
is meant by DOS and
why it needs to have an
ASCII code value.

» create a universal standard that covered all languages and all writing systems
» produce a more efficient coding system than ASCII
» adopt uniform encoding where each character is encoded as 16-bit or 32-bit
code
» create unambiguous encoding where each 16-bit and 32-bit value always
represents the same character
» reserve part of the code for private use to enable a user to assign codes for
their own characters and symbols (useful for Chinese and Japanese character
sets, for example).
A sample of Unicode characters are shown in Figure 1.7. As can be seen from the
figure, characters used in languages such as Russian, Romanian and Croatian can
now be represented in a computer).

1.2 Text, sound and images

1.2.2 Representation of sound
Soundwaves are vibrations in the air. The human ear senses these vibrations and
interprets them as sound.
Each sound wave has a frequency, wavelength and amplitude. The amplitude
specifies the loudness of the sound.

Period

▲ Figure 1.8 High and low frequency wave signals

Sound waves vary continuously. This means that sound is analogue. Computers
cannot work with analogue data, so sound waves need to be sampled in order to
be stored in a computer. Sampling means measuring the amplitude of the sound
wave. This is done using an analogue to digital converter (ADC).

Sound amplitude

To convert the analogue data to digital, the sound waves are sampled at regular
time intervals. The amplitude of the sound cannot be measured precisely, so
approximate values are stored.

Time intervals

▲ Figure 1.9 A sound wave being sampled

Figure 1.9 shows a sound wave. The x-axis shows the time intervals when the
sound was sampled (1 to 21), and the y-axis shows the amplitude of the sampled
sound to 10.
At time interval 1, the approximate amplitude is 10; at time interval 2, the
approximate amplitude is 4, and so on for all 20 time intervals. Because the
amplitude range in Figure 1.9 is 0 to 10, then 4 binary bits can be used to
represent each amplitude value (for example, 9 would be represented by the

1 Data representation

binary value 1001). Increasing the number of possible values used to represent
sound amplitude also increases the accuracy of the sampled sound (for example,
using a range of 0 to 127 gives a much more accurate representation of the
sound sample than using a range of, for example, 0 to 10). The number of bits per
sample is known as the sampling resolution (also known as the bit depth). So,
in our example, the sampling resolution is 4 bits.
Sampling rate is the number of sound samples taken per second. This is
measured in hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz means ‘one sample per second’.
So how is sampling used to record a sound clip?
» the amplitude of the sound wave is first determined at set time intervals (the
sampling rate)
» this gives an approximate representation of the sound wave
» each sample of the sound wave is then encoded as a series of binary digits.
Using a higher sampling rate or larger resolution will result in a more faithful
representation of the original sound source. However, the higher the sampling
rate and/or sampling resolution, the greater the file size.
▼ Table 1.3 The benefits and drawbacks of using a larger sampling resolution when
recording sound
Benefits

Drawbacks

larger dynamic range

produces larger file size

better sound quality

takes longer to transmit/download music files

less sound distortion

requires greater processing power

Link

CDs have a 16-bit sampling resolution and a 44.1 kHz sample rate – that is 44 100
samples every second. This gives high-quality sound reproduction.

See Section 1.3 for
a calculation of file
sizes.

1.2.3 Representation of (bitmap) images
Bitmap images are made up of pixels (picture elements); an image is made up of
a two-dimensional matrix of pixels. Pixels can take different shapes such as:

▲ Figure 1.10

Each pixel can be represented as a binary number, and so a bitmap image is
stored in a computer as a series of binary numbers, so that:
» a black and white image only requires 1 bit per pixel – this means that each pixel
can be one of two colours, corresponding to either 1 or 0
» if each pixel is represented by 2 bits, then each pixel can be one of four colours
(22 = 4), corresponding to 00, 01, 10, or 11
» if each pixel is represented by 3 bits then each pixel can be one of eight colours
(23 = 8), corresponding to 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.
The number of bits used to represent each colour is called the colour depth.
An 8 bit colour depth means that each pixel can be one of 256 colours (because
30

318281_C01_CAM_IGCSE CO_SCI_001_044.indd 30

18/02/21 3:22 PM

1.2 Text, sound and images

28 = 256). Modern computers have a 24 bit colour depth, which means over
16 million different colours can be represented With x pixels, 2x colours can be
represented as a generalisation. Increasing colour depth also increases the size
of the file when storing an image.
Image resolution refers to the number of pixels that make up an image; for
example, an image could contain 4096 × 3072 pixels (12 582 912 pixels in total).
The resolution can be varied on many cameras before taking, for example, a
digital photograph. Photographs with a lower resolution have less detail than
those with a higher resolution. For example, look at Figure 1.11:

A

B

C

D

E

▲ Figure 1.11 Five images of the same car wheel using different resolutions

Image ‘A’ has the highest resolution and ‘E’ has the lowest resolution. ‘E’ has
become pixelated (‘fuzzy’). This is because there are fewer pixels in ‘E’ to
represent the image.
The main drawback of using high resolution images is the increase in file size.
As the number of pixels used to represent the image is increased, the size of
the file will also increase. This impacts on how many images can be stored on,
for example, a hard drive. It also impacts on the time to download an image
from the internet or the time to transfer images from device to device. A certain
amount of reduction in resolution of an image is possible before the loss of
quality becomes noticeable.

1 Data representation

1.3 Data storage and file compression
1.3.1 Measurement of data storage
A bit is the basic unit of all computing memory storage terms and is either 1 or 0.
The word comes from binary digit. The byte is the smallest unit of memory in a
computer. 1 byte is 8 bits. A 4-bit number is called a nibble – half a byte.
1 byte of memory wouldn’t allow you to store very much information so memory
size is measured in the multiples shown in Table 1.4:
▼ Table 1.4 Memory size using denary values
Name of memory size

Equivalent denary value

1 kilobyte (1 KB)

bytes

1 exabyte (1 EB)

1 000 000 000 000 000 000 bytes

The above system of numbering now only refers to some storage devices but is
technically inaccurate. It is based on the SI (base 10) system of units where
1 kilo is equal to 1000.
A 1 TB hard disk drive would allow the storage of 1 × 1012 bytes according to this
system.
However, since memory size is actually measured in terms of powers of 2, another
system has been adopted by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
that is based on the binary system (Table 1.5):
▼ Table 1.5 IEC memory size system

Advice

is covered in the
syllabus.

This system is more accurate. Internal memories (such as RAM and ROM) should
be measured using the IEC system. A 64 GiB RAM could, therefore, store 64 × 230
bytes of data (68 719 476 736 bytes).

In this section we will look at the calculation of the file size required to hold a
bitmap image and a sound sample.
The file size of an image is calculated as:
image resolution (in pixels) × colour depth (in bits)

The size of a mono sound file is calculated as:
sample rate (in Hz) × sample resolution (in bits) × length of sample (in seconds)

For a stereo sound file, you would then multiply the result by two.

Example 1
A photograph is 1024 × 1080 pixels and uses a colour depth of 32 bits. How many
photographs of this size would fit onto a memory stick of 64 GiB?
1 Multiply number of pixels in vertical and horizontal directions to find total number
of pixels = (1024 × 1080) = 1 105 920 pixels
2 Now multiply number of pixels by colour depth then divide by 8 to give the number
of bytes = 1 105 920 × 32 = 35 389 440/8 bytes = 4 423 680 bytes
3 64 GiB = 64 × 1024 × 1024 × 1024 = 68 719 476 736 bytes
4 Finally divide the memory stick size by the files size = 68 719 476 736/4 423 680
= 15 534 photos.

Example 2
A camera detector has an array of 2048 by 2048 pixels and uses a colour depth of 16.
Find the size of an image taken by this camera in MiB.
1 Multiply number of pixels in vertical and horizontal directions to find total number
of pixels = (2 048 × 2 048) = 4 194 304 pixels
2 Now multiply number of pixels by colour depth = 4 194 304 × 16 = 67 108 864 bits
3 Now divide number of bits by 8 to find the number of bytes in the file
= (67 108 864)/8 = 8 388 608 bytes
4 Now divide by 1024 × 1024 to convert to MiB = (8 388 608)/(1 048 576) = 8 MiB.

Example 3
An audio CD has a sample rate of 44 100 and a sample resolution of 16 bits. The music
being sampled uses two channels to allow for stereo recording. Calculate the file size
for a 60-minute recording.
1 Size of file =

sample rate (in Hz) × sample resolution (in bits) × length of sample (in seconds)

Size of sample = (44 100 × 16 × (60 × 60)) = 2 540 160 000 bits
Multiply by 2 since there are two channels being used = 5 080 320 000 bits
Divide by 8 to find number of bytes = (5 080 320 000)/8 = 635 040 000
Divide by 1024 × 1024 to convert to MiB = 635 040 000 / 1 048 576 = 605 MiB.

Activity 1.16
1 A camera detector has an array of 1920 by 1536 pixels. A colour depth of 16 bits
is used. Calculate the size of a photograph taken by this camera, giving your
answer in MiB.
2 Photographs have been taken by a smartphone which uses a detector with a
1024 × 1536 pixel array. The software uses a colour depth of 24 bits. How many
photographs could be stored on a 16 GiB memory card?
3 Audio is being sampled at the rate of 44.1 kHz using 8 bits. Two channels are
being used. Calculate:
a the size of a one second sample, in bits
b the size of a 30-second audio recording in MiB.
4 The typical song stored on a music CD is 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Assuming
each song is sampled at 44.1 kHz (44 100 samples per second) and 16 bits are
used per sample. Each song utilises two channels.
Calculate how many typical songs could be stored on a 740 MiB CD.

1.3.3 Data compression
The calculations in Section 1.3.2 show that sound and image files can be very
large. It is therefore necessary to reduce (or compress) the size of a file for the
following reasons:
» to save storage space on devices such as the hard disk drive/solid state drive
» to reduce the time taken to stream a music or video file
» to reduce the time taken to upload, download or transfer a file across a network
» the download/upload process uses up network bandwidth – this is the
maximum rate of transfer of data across a network, measured in bits per
second. This occurs whenever a file is downloaded, for example, from a server.
Compressed files contain fewer bits of data than uncompressed files and
therefore use less bandwidth, which results in a faster data transfer rate.
» reduced file size also reduces costs. For example, when using cloud storage,
the cost is based on the size of the files stored. Also an internet service
provider (ISP) may charge a user based on the amount of data downloaded.

1.3.4 Lossy and lossless file compression
File compression can either be lossless or lossy.

Lossy file compression
With this technique, the file compression algorithm eliminates unnecessary data
from the file. This means the original file cannot be reconstructed once it has
been compressed.
Lossy file compression results in some loss of detail when compared to the
original file. The algorithms used in the lossy technique have to decide which
parts of the file need to be retained and which parts can be discarded.
For example, when applying a lossy file compression algorithm to:
» an image, it may reduce the resolution and/or the bit/colour depth
» a sound file, it may reduce the sampling rate and/or the resolution.

1.3 Data storage and file compression

Lossy files are smaller than lossless files which is of great benefit when
considering storage and data transfer rate requirements.
Common lossy file compression algorithms are:
» MPEG-3 (MP3) and MPEG-4 (MP4)
» JPEG.
MPEG-3 (MP3) and MPEG-4 (MP4)
MP3 files are used for playing music on computers or mobile phones. This
compression technology will reduce the size of a normal music file by about 90%.
While MP3 music files can never match the sound quality found on a DVD or CD,
the quality is satisfactory for most general purposes.

But how can the original music file be reduced by 90% while still retaining most
of the music quality? Essentially the algorithm removes sounds that the human
ear can’t hear properly. For example:
» removal of sounds outside the human ear range
» if two sounds are played at the same time, only the louder one can be heard
by the ear, so the softer sound is eliminated. This is called perceptual music
shaping.
MP4 files are slightly different to MP3 files. This format allows the storage of
multimedia files rather than just sound – music, videos, photos and animation
can all be stored in the MP4 format. As with MP3, this is a lossy file compression
format, but it still retains an acceptable quality of sound and video. Movies,
for example, could be streamed over the internet using the MP4 format without
losing any real discernible quality.
JPEG
When a camera takes a photograph, it produces a raw bitmap file which can
be very large in size. These files are temporary in nature. JPEG is a lossy file
compression algorithm used for bitmap images. As with MP3, once the image
is subjected to the JPEG compression algorithm, a new file is formed and the
original file can no longer be constructed.

The JPEG file reduction process is based on two key concepts:
» human eyes don’t detect differences in colour shades quite as well as they
detect differences in image brightness (the eye is less sensitive to colour
variations than it is to variations in brightness)
» by separating pixel colour from brightness, images can be split into 8 × 8 pixel
blocks, for example, which then allows certain ‘information’ to be discarded
from the image without causing any real noticeable deterioration in quality.

Lossless file compression
With this technique, all the data from the original uncompressed file can be
reconstructed. This is particularly important for files where any loss of data
would be disastrous (e.g. when transferring a large and complex spreadsheet or
when downloading a large computer application).

1 Data representation

Lossless file compression is designed so that none of the original detail from the
file is lost.
Run-length encoding (RLE) can be used for lossless compression of a number of
different file formats:
» it is a form of lossless/reversible file compression
» it reduces the size of a string of adjacent, identical data (e.g. repeated colours
in an image)
» a repeating string is encoded into two values:
– the first value represents the number of identical data items (e.g.
characters) in the run
– the second value represents the code of the data item (such as ASCII code
if it is a keyboard character)
» RLE is only effective where there is a long run of repeated units/bits.
Using RLE on text data
Consider the following text string: ‘aaaaabbbbccddddd’. Assuming each character
requires 1 byte then this string needs 16 bytes. If we assume ASCII code is being
used, then the string can be coded as follows:
a

a

a

a

A

b

05 97

b

b

b

c

04 98

c

d

d

02 99

d

d

d

05 100

This means we have five characters with ASCII code 97, four characters with
ASCII code 98, two characters with ASCII code 99 and five characters with ASCII
code 100. Assuming each number in the second row requires 1 byte of memory,
the RLE code will need 8 bytes. This is half the original file size.
One issue occurs with a string such as ‘cdcdcdcdcd’ where RLE compression isn’t
very effective. To cope with this, we use a flag. A flag preceding data indicates
that what follows are the number of repeating units (for example, 255 05 97
where 255 is the flag and the other two numbers indicate that there are five
items with ASCII code 97). When a flag is not used, the next byte(s) are taken
with their face value and a run of 1 (for example, 01 99 means one character
with ASCII code 99 follows).
Consider this example:
String
Code

aaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbb
08 97

10 98

c
01 99

d

c

d

c

d

01 100 01 99 01 100 01 99 01 100

eeeeeeee
08 101

The original string contains 32 characters and would occupy 32 bytes of storage.
The coded version contains 18 values and would require 18 bytes of storage.
Introducing a flag (255 in this case) produces:
255 08 97 •• 255 10 98 •• 99 100 99 100 99 100 •• 255 08 101

This has 15 values and would, therefore, require 15 bytes of storage. This is a
reduction in file size of about 53% when compared to the original string.

1.3 Data storage and file compression

Using RLE with images

Example 1: Black and white image
Figure 1.12 shows the letter ‘F’ in a grid where each square requires 1 byte of storage.
A white square has a value 1 and a black square a value of 0:
11111111
10000001
10111111
10111111
10000011
10111111
10111111
10111111

In compressed RLE format this becomes:
9W 6B 2W 1B 7W 1B 7W 5B 3W 1B 7W 1B
7W 1B 6W
Using W = 1 and B = 0 we get:
91 60 21 10 71 10 71 50 31 10 71 10 71 10 61

▲ Figure 1.12 Using RLE with a black and white image

The 8 × 8 grid would need 64 bytes; the compressed RLE format has 30 values, and
therefore needs only 30 bytes to store the image.

Example 2: Coloured images
Figure 1.13 shows an object in four colours. Each colour is made up of red, green and
blue (RGB) according to the code on the right.

▲ Figure 1.13 Using RLE with a coloured image

This produces the following data: 2 0 0 0 4 0 255 0 3 0 0 0 6 255 255 255 1 0 0 0
2 0 255 0 4 255 0 0 4 0 255 0 1 255 255 255 2 255 0 0 1 255 255 255 4 0 255 0
4 255 0 0 4 0 255 0 4 255 255 255 2 0 255 0 1 0 0 0 2 255 255 255 2 255 0 0
2 255 255 255 3 0 0 0 4 0 255 0 2 0 0 0.
The original image (8 × 8 square) would need 3 bytes per square (to include
all three RGB values). Therefore, the uncompressed file for this image is
8 × 8 × 3 = 192 bytes.
The RLE code has 92 values, which means the compressed file will be 92 bytes in
size. This gives a file reduction of about 52%. It should be noted that the file
reductions in reality will not be as large as this due to other data which needs to
be stored with the compressed file (e.g. a file header).

1 Data representation

Extension
For those students considering the study of this
subject at A Level, the following section gives some
insight into further study on data representation.

Uses of BCD
The most obvious use of BCD is in the representation
of digits on a calculator or clock display. For example:

180.3

The following two exercises are designed to help
students thinking of furthering their study in
Computer Science at A Level standard. The two
topics here are not covered in the syllabus and
merely show how some of the topics in this chapter
can be extended to this next level. The two topics
extend uses of the binary number system and using
two’s complement format to do binary addition.

Each denary digit will have a BCD equivalent value
which makes it easy to convert from computer output
to denary display.
Questions to try
1 Convert the following denary numbers into BCD
format:
a 271
b 5006
c 7990
2 Convert the following BCD numbers into denary
numbers:
a 1001 0011 0111
b 0111 0111 0110 0010

Topic 1: Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)
The Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) system uses a 4-bit
code to represent each denary digit, i.e.:
0 0 0 0 = 0		

0101=5

0 0 0 1 = 1		

0110=6

0 0 1 0 = 2		

0111=7

0 0 1 1 = 3		

1000=8

0 1 0 0 = 4		

1001=9

Topic 2: Subtraction using two’s complement
notation
To carry out subtraction in binary, we convert the
number being subtracted into its negative equivalent
using two’s complementation and then add the two
numbers.

Therefore, the denary number, 3 1 6 5, would
be 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 in BCD format.

Example 1
Carry out the subtraction 95 – 68 in binary.
First convert the two numbers into binary:

95  =   0   1  0  1  1  1   1  1
      68  =  0   1  0  0   0  1  0   0

Now find the two’s complement of 68:

            1   0  1  1  1  0   1  1
      +                                         1
   −68  =   1  0   1  1  1  1   0   0

Then add 95 and −68:
−128

The additional ninth bit is simply ignored leaving the binary number: 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 (denary equivalent of 27
which is the correct result of the subtraction).

1.3 Data storage and file compression

Example 2
Carry out the subtraction 49 – 80 in binary.
First convert the two numbers into binary:
  49  =  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  1
                      80  =  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  0
Now find the two’s complement of 68:

1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1
                       +                                      1
                    −80  =  1  0  1  1  0  0  0  0

Now add 49 and −80:
