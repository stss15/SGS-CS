Key terms used throughout this chapter
logic gate – an electronic circuit that relies on ‘on/off’ logic; the most common gates are
NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR
logic circuit – these are formed from a combination of logic gates and designed to carry out
a particular task; the output from a logic circuit will be 0 or 1
truth table – a method of checking the output from a logic circuit; a truth table lists all the
possible binary input combinations and their associated outputs; the number of outputs
will depend on the number of inputs; for example, two inputs have 22 (4) possible binary
combinations, three inputs have 2 3 (8) possible binary combinations, and so on
Boolean algebra – a form of algebra linked to logic circuits and based on TRUE or FALSE
