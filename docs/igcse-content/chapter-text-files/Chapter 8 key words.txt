Key terms used throughout this chapter
variable – a named data store that contains a value that
may change during the execution of a program
constant – a named data store that contains a value that
does not change during the execution of a program
declare – define the value and data type of a variable or constant
integer – a positive or negative whole number that can be
used with mathematical operators
real number – a positive or negative number with
a fractional part; Real numbers can be used with
mathematical operators
char – a variable or constant that is a single character
string – a variable or constant that is several characters
in length. Strings vary in length and may even have no
characters (an empty string); the characters can be letters
and/or digits and/or any other printable symbol
sequence – the order in which the steps in a program are
executed
selection – allowing the selection of different paths through
the steps of a program
iteration – a section of programming code that can be
repeated under certain conditions
counting – keeping track of the number of times an action
is performed
totalling – keeping a total that values are added to
operator – a special character or word in a programming
language that identifies an action to be performed
arithmetic operator – an operator that is used to perform
calculations
logical operator – an operator that is used to decide the
path to take through a program if the expression formed is
true or false

Boolean operator – an operator that is used with logical
operators to form more complex expressions
nesting – the inclusion of one type of code construct inside
another
procedure – a set of programming statements grouped
together under a single name that can be called to perform
a task in a program, rather than including a copy of the code
every time the task is performed
function – a set of programming statements grouped
together under a single name which can be called to
perform a task in a program, rather than including a copy of
the code every time; just like a procedure except a function
will return a value back to the main program
parameters – the variables in a procedure or function
declaration that store the values of the arguments passed
from the main program to a procedure or function
MOD – an arithmetic operator that returns the remainder
of a division; different languages use different symbols for
this operation
DIV – an arithmetic operator that returns the quotient
(whole number part) of a division; different languages use
different symbols for this operation
ROUND – a library routine that rounds a value to a given
number of decimal places
RANDOM – a library routine that generates a random
number
array – a data structure containing several elements of the
same data type; these elements can be accessed using the
same identifier name
index – identifies the position of an element in an array
file – a collection of data stored by a computer program to
be used again
