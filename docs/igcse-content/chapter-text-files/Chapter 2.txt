Data transmission
In this chapter you will learn about:
★ types and methods of data transmission
– how data is broken up into data packets before transmission
– the structure of data packets (header, payload and trailer)
– packet switching (including the role of the router in the process)
– methods of data transmission (serial, parallel, simplex, half-duplex and
full-duplex)
– the Universal Serial Bus (USB)
★ methods of error detection
– why error checking methods are needed
– error checking methods following data transmission:
– parity checks
– checksum
– echo check
– use of check digits to detect data entry errors
– use of automatic repeat requests (ARQs) to detect errors
★ encryption
– the need for and the purpose of encryption
– symmetric and asymmetric encryption
– use of public and private keys.

Data is frequently transferred from one device to another. The two
devices could be in the same building or thousands of kilometres away.
Irrespective of the distance travelled, the transmission of data needs to be
considered with respect to:
l how the data is transmitted
l how can errors following transmission be detected and can the data
be recovered
l the role of encryption to make sure data that falls into the wrong hands
can’t be used
It is also important to consider ways of checking for errors in data once it
has been entered into a computer.

2.1 Types and methods of data transmission
Data packets are
usually referred to
simply as ‘packets’

2.1.1 Data packets
Data sent over long distances is usually broken up into data packets (sometimes
called datagrams). The packets of data are usually quite small, typically 64 KiB,
which are much easier to control than a long continuous stream of data. The idea
of splitting up data in this way means each packet can be sent along a different
route to its destination. This would clearly be of great benefit if a particular
transmission route was out of action or very busy. The only obvious drawback of

2 Data transmission

splitting data into packets is the need to reassemble the data when it reaches its
destination.

Packet structure
A typical packet is split up into:
» a packet header
» the payload
» a trailer.
Header

IP address of
the source
device (sender)

IP address of
the destination
device (receiver)

Sequence
number of
the packet
(allowing correct
reassembly)

Payload

Size of the
packet (in
bytes)

The actual data
in the packets
(~64 KiB) – the
payload

Trailer

Method of
identifying the
end of the
packet

Some form of
error checking
to ensure
packet arrives
error-free

▲ Figure 2.1 Packet structure

For each packet, the packet header consists of:
» the IP address of the sending device
» the IP address of the receiving device
» the sequence number of the packet (this is to ensure that all the packets can
be reassembled into the correct order once they reach the destination)
» packet size (this is to ensure the receiving station can check if all of the
packets have arrived intact).
(Note: the header often also contains another value indicating how many packets
there are in total for this transmission.)
For each packet, the payload consists of the actual data being sent in the packet
(this is usually about 64 KiB).
For each packet, the packet trailer consists of:
» some way of identifying the end of the packet; this is essential to allow
each packet to be separated from each other as they travel from sending to
receiving station
» an error checking method; cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) are used to check
data packets:
– this involves the sending computer adding up all the 1-bits in the payload
and storing this as a hex value in the trailer before it is sent
– once the packet arrives, the receiving computer recalculates the number of
1-bits in the payload
– the computer then checks this value against the one sent in the trailer
– if the two values match, then no transmission errors have occurred;
otherwise the packet needs to be re-sent.

2.1 Types and methods of data transmission

Packet switching
Let us now consider what happens when a photograph, for example, is sent from
computer ‘A’ to computer ‘B’. The photograph will be split up into a number of
packets before it is sent. There will be several possible routes for the packets,
between computer ‘A’ (sender) and computer ‘B’ (receiver). Each stage in the route
contains a router. A router receives a data packet and, based on the information
in the header, decides where to send it next. For example:
Computer ‘B’
Note: R1 to R10 represent the
routers (nodes) in the network
between ‘A’ and ‘B’

▲ Figure 2.2 Typical network showing possible routes between ‘A’ and ‘B’

Packet switching is a method of data transmission in which a message is broken
up into a number of packets. Each packet can then be sent independently
from start point to end point. At the destination, the packets will need to be
reassembled into their correct order (using the information sent in the header).
At each stage in the transmission, there are nodes that contain a router. Each
router will determine which route the packet needs to take, in order to reach its
destination (the destination IP address is used in this part of the process).
Suppose our photograph (Figure 2.3) has been split up into five packets that have
been sent in the following order:
▲ Figure 2.3

» each packet will follow its own path (route)
» routers will determine the route of each packet
» routing selection depends on the number of packets waiting to be processed
at each node
» the shortest possible path available is always selected – this may not always
be the shortest path that could be taken, since certain parts of the route may
be too busy or not suitable
» unfortunately, packets can reach the destination in a different order to that in
which they were sent.
Figure 2.5 shows one possible scenario. Notice the different paths taken by
each packet from computer ‘A’ to computer ‘B’. Also notice that the packets have
arrived in a different order compared to the way they were sent, namely:

» there is no need to tie up a single communication line
» it is possible to overcome failed, busy or faulty lines by simply re-routing
packets
» it is relatively easy to expand package usage
» a high data transmission rate is possible.
The drawbacks of packet switching include:
» packets can be lost and need to be re-sent
» the method is more prone to errors with real-time streaming (for example, a
live sporting event being transmitted over the internet)
» there is a delay at the destination whilst the packets are being re-ordered.
Sometimes it is possible for packets to get lost because they keep ‘bouncing’ around
from router to router and never actually reach their destination. Eventually the
network would just grind to a halt as the number of lost packets mount up,
clogging up the system. To overcome this, a method called hopping is used. A
hop number is added to the header of each packet, and this number is reduced
by 1 every time it leaves a router (Figure 2.6).

Hop number:

▲ Figure 2.6  Hop numbers between routers

Each packet has a maximum hop number to start with. Once a hop number
reaches zero, and the packet hasn’t reached its destination, then the packet is
deleted when it reaches the next router. The missing packets will then be flagged
by the receiving computer and a request to re-send these packets will be made.

2.1.2 Data transmission
Data transmission can be either over a short distance (for example, computer
to printer) or over longer distances (for example, from one computer to another
in a global network). Essentially, three factors need to be considered when
transmitting data:
» the direction of data transmission (for example, can data transmit in one
direction only, or in both directions)
» the method of transmission (for example, how many bits can be sent at the
same time)
» how will data be synchronised (that is, how to make sure the received data is
in the correct order).
These factors are usually considered by a communication protocol.

▲ Figure 2.8 Transmission modes

Simplex data transmission
Simplex mode occurs when data can be sent in ONE DIRECTION ONLY (for
example, from sender to receiver). An example of this would be sending data
from a computer to a printer.
Half-duplex data transmission
Half-duplex mode occurs when data is sent in BOTH DIRECTIONS but NOT AT
THE SAME TIME (for example, data can be sent from ‘A’ to ‘B’ and from ‘B’ to ‘A’
along the same transmission line, but they can’t both be done at the same time).
An example of this would be a walkie-talkie where a message can be sent in one
direction only at a time; but messages can be both received and sent.
Full-duplex data transmission
Full-duplex mode occurs when data can be sent in BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE
SAME TIME (for example, data can be sent from ‘A’ to ‘B’ and from ‘B’ to ‘A’
along the same transmission line simultaneously). An example of this would be a
broadband internet connection.

(Note: Serial data transmission can be simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex.)
Serial data transmission works well over long distances. However, the data is
transmitted at a slower rate than parallel data transmission. Because only one
channel/wire is used, data will arrive at its destination fully synchronised (i.e.
in the correct order). An example of its use is when connecting a computer to a
printer via a USB connection (see Section 2.1.3).

the CPU refer to
Chapter 3.

Parallel data transmission works well over short distances. Over longer distances
(for example, over 20 metres), data can become skewed (that is, the data can
arrive unsynchronised) and bits can arrive out of order. The longer the wire, the
worse this can become. It is, however, a faster method of data transmission than
serial. The internal circuits in a computer use parallel data transmission since the
distance travelled between components is very short and high-speed transmission
is essential.

As the name suggests, the universal serial bus (USB) is a form of serial data
transmission. USB is now the most common type of input/output port found on
computers and has led to a standardisation method for the transfer of data
between devices and a computer. It is important to note that USB allows both
half-duplex and full-duplex data transmission.

▲ Figure 2.12  Typical USB cable

As Figure 2.12 shows, the USB cable consists of a four-wired shielded cable, with two
wires for power (red and black). The other two wires (white and green) are for data
transmission. When a device is plugged into a computer using one of the USB ports:
» the computer automatically detects that a device is present (this is due to a
small change in the voltage on the data signal wires in the USB cable)
» the device is automatically recognised, and the appropriate device driver
software is loaded up so that the computer and device can communicate
effectively
» if a new device is detected, the computer will look for the device driver that
matches the device; if this is not available, the user is prompted to download
the appropriate driver software (some systems do this automatically and the
user will see a notice asking for permission to connect to the device website).

We will now consider the benefits and drawbacks of using the USB system:

Drawbacks

devices plugged into the computer are automatically detected and device
drivers are automatically loaded up

standard USB only supports a maximum
cable length of 5 m; beyond that, USB hubs
are needed to extend the cable length

connections can only fit one way preventing incorrect connections being made
it has become an industry standard, which means considerable support is
available
can support different data transmission rates (from 1.5 Mbps to 5 Gbps)
no need for external power source since cable supplies +5 V power
USB protocol notifies the transmitter to re- transmit data if any errors are
detected; this leads to error-free data transmission
it is relatively easy to add more USB ports if necessary, by using USB hubs
USB is backward compatible (that is, older versions are still supported)

even though USB is backward compatible,
very early USB standards (V1) may
not always be supported by the latest
computers
even the latest version 3 (V3) and version
4 (V4) USB-C systems have a data transfer
rate which is slow compared to, for
example, Ethernet connections (Note: USB
V2 has a maximum data transfer rate of
480 Mbps.)

A new type of USB connector, referred to as USB-C, is now becoming more
common in laptops and tablets/phones. This is a 24-pin symmetrical connector
which means it will fit into a USB-C port either way round. It is much smaller
and thinner than older USB connectors, offers 100 watt (20 volt) power
connectivity, which means full-sized devices can now be charged and it can
carry data at 10 gigabits per second (10 Gbps); this means it can now support
4K video delivery.
USB-C is backward compatible (to USB 2.0 and 3.0) provided a suitable adaptor is
used, and is expected to become the new industry standard (universal) format.

2 Data transmission

2.2 Methods of error detection
2.2.1 The need to check for errors
When data is transmitted, there is always a risk that it may be corrupted, lost or
even gained.
Errors can occur during data transmission due to:
» interference (all types of cable can suffer from electrical interference, which
can cause data to be corrupted or even lost)
» problems during packet switching (this can lead to data loss – or it is even
possible to gain data!)
» skewing of data (this occurs during parallel data transmission and can cause
data corruption if the bits arrive out of synchronisation).
Checking for errors is important since computers are unable to understand text,
for example, if the words are not recognised by its built-in dictionary. Look at the
following example of some corrupted text:
Can you raed tihs?
“I cnduo’t bvleiee taht I culod aulaclty uesdtannrd waht I was rdnaieg.

(from an unknown source at Cambridge University)
▲ Figure 2.13 Example of data corruption on a message

Whilst you probably had little problem understanding this text, a computer
would be unable to make any sense of it. Data corruption is therefore a very real
problem to a computer. Figure 2.13 could be the result of some data corruption
following transmission which would make the text unintelligible to a computer.
This is why error checking is such an important part of computer technology.
The following section considers a number of ways that can be used to check for
errors, so that you don’t end up with text as shown in Figure 2.13 above!
There are a number of ways data can be checked for errors following
transmission:
» parity checks
» checksum
» echo check.

2.2 Methods of error detection

2.2.2 Parity checks, checksum and echo checks
Parity checks
Parity checking is one method used to check whether data has been changed or
corrupted following data transmission. This method is based on the number of
1-bits in a byte of data.
The parity can be either called EVEN (that is, an even number of 1-bits in the
byte) or ODD (that is, an odd number of 1-bits in the byte). One of the bits in
the byte (usually the most significant bit or left-most bit) is reserved for a parity
bit. The parity bit is set according to whether the parity being used is even or
odd. For example, consider the byte:
1

1

0

1

1

0

0

parity bit

Advice
Note for the 7 bit
number 1110000, the
even parity bit would
be 1 and the odd parity
bit would be 0. The
parity bit can be set
as a 1 or a 0 for either
choice of parity – it just
depends on how many
1s are in the byte.

In this example, if the byte is using even parity, then the parity bit needs to be
set to 0, since there is already an even number of 1-bits in the byte (four 1-bits).
We thus get:
0

1

1

0

1

1

0

0

parity bit

In this example, if the byte is using odd parity, then the parity bit needs to be
set to 1, since we need to have an odd number of 1-bits in the byte. We thus get:
1

1

1

0

1

1

0

0

parity bit

Before data is transferred, an agreement is made between sender and receiver
regarding which type of parity is being used. Parity checks are therefore being
used as a type of transmission protocol.

2 Data transmission

If a byte has been transmitted from ‘A’ to ‘B’, and if even parity is used, an error
would be flagged if the byte now had an odd number of 1-bits at the receiver’s
end. For example (assuming even parity is being used):
0

byte being sent:

1

0

1

1

1

0

0

0

0

1

1

0

0

parity bit
0

byte being received:

1

parity bit

In this case, the byte received has three 1-bits, which means it now has odd
parity; while the sender’s byte was using even parity (four 1-bits). This means an
error has occurred during the transmission of the byte. The error is detected by
the recipient’s computer re-calculating the parity of the byte sent. If even parity
had been agreed between sender and receiver, then a change in parity in the
received byte indicates that a transmission error has occurred.

2 In each case, in question 1, where an error occurred, can you work out which
bit in the byte was changed during data transmission?

If two of the bits change value following data transmission, it may be impossible
to locate the error using parity checking.
Let us imagine we are transmitting the following byte, using even parity:
0

1

0

1

1

1

0

0

Suppose more than one bit has been modified during data transmission. This
means the byte could have reached the destination as any of the following:
0

1

1

1

1

1

0

1

six 1-bits

In all these cases, the byte has clearly been corrupted, but the bytes have
retained even parity. Therefore, no error would be flagged in spite of the
obvious errors in transmission. Clearly it will be necessary to have other ways to
complement parity when it comes to error checking to ensure errors are never
missed. One such method is called checksum – see the next section.
You should have concluded that any of the bits in question 2 (Activity 2.5) could
have been changed where there was a transmission error. Therefore, even though
an error has been flagged, it is impossible to know exactly which bit is in error.
One of the ways round this problem is to use parity blocks. In this method,
a block of data is sent and the number of 1-bits are totalled horizontally and
vertically (in other words, a parity check is done in both horizontal and vertical
directions). As the following example shows, this method not only identifies that
an error has occurred but also indicates where the error is.

Example 1
In this example, nine bytes of data have been transmitted. Agreement has been made
that even parity will be used. Another byte, known as the parity byte, has also been
sent. This byte consists entirely of the parity bits produced by the vertical parity
check. The parity byte also indicates the end of the block of data.
Table 2.3 shows how the data arrived at the receiving end. It is now necessary to check
the parity of each byte horizontally (bytes 1 to 9) and vertically (columns 1 to 8). Each
row and column where the parity has changed from even to odd should be flagged:

A careful study of Table 2.3 shows the following:
» byte 8 (row 8) now has incorrect parity (there are three 1-bits)
» bit 5 (column 5) also now has incorrect parity (there are five 1-bits).
First of all, the table shows that an error has occurred following data transmission
(there has been a change in parity in one of the bytes).

2 Data transmission
Secondly, at the intersection of row 8 and column 5, the position of the incorrect bit
value (which caused the error) can be found. The 1-bit at this intersection should be a
0-bit; this means that byte 8 should have been:
0

which would also correct column 5 giving an even vertical parity (now has four 1-bits).
This byte could therefore be corrected automatically as shown above, or an error
message could be relayed back to the sender asking them to re-transmit the block
of data.

2.2 Methods of error detection

Checksum
A checksum is a method used to check if data has been changed or corrupted
following data transmission. Data is sent in blocks, and an additional value,
called the checksum, is sent at the end of the block of data.
The checksum process is as follows:
» when a block of data is about to be transmitted, the checksum is calculated
from the block of data
» the calculation is done using an agreed algorithm (this algorithm has been
agreed by sender and receiver)
» the checksum is then transmitted with the block of data
» at the receiving end, the checksum is recalculated by the computer using the
block of data (the agreed algorithm is used to find the checksum)
» the re-calculated checksum is then compared to the checksum sent with the
data block
» if the two checksums are the same, then no transmission errors have occurred;
otherwise a request is made to re-send the block of data.

Echo check
With echo check, when data is sent to another device, this data is sent back
again to the sender. The sender’s computer compares the two sets of data to
check if any errors occurred during the transmission process.
As you will have no doubt worked out, this isn’t very reliable. If the two sets of
data are different, it isn’t known whether the error occurred when sending the data
in the first place, or if the error occurred when sending the data back for checking.
However, if no errors occurred, then it is another way to check that the data was
transmitted correctly. In summary:
» a copy of the data is sent back to the sender
» the returned data is compared with the original data by the sender’s computer
» if there are no differences, then the data was sent without error
» if the two sets of data are different, then an error occurred at some stage
during the data transmission.

2.2.3 Check digits
A check digit is the final digit included in a code; it is calculated from all the
other digits in the code. Check digits are used for barcodes on products, such as
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) and Vehicle Identification Numbers

(VIN). Check digits are used to identify errors in data entry caused by mis-typing
or mis-scanning a barcode. They can usually detect the following types of error:
» an incorrect digit entered, for example 5327 entered instead of 5307
» transposition errors where two numbers have changed order, for example 5037
instead of 5307
» omitted or extra digits, for example 537 instead of 5307 or 53107 instead
of 5307
» phonetic errors, for example 13 (thirteen), instead of 30 (thirty).

▲ Figure 2.15 Sample barcode (ISBN 13 code with check digit)

There are a number of different methods used to generate a check digit. Two
common methods will be considered here:
» ISBN 13
» Modulo-11

Example 1: ISBN 13
The check digit in ISBN 13 is the thirteenth digit in the number. We will now consider
two different calculations. The first calculation is the generation of the check digit.
The second calculation is a verification of the check digit (that is, a recalculation).
Calculation 1 – Generation of the check digit from the other 12 digits in a number
The following algorithm generates the check digit from the 12 other digits:
1 add all the odd numbered digits together
2 add all the even numbered digits together and multiply the result by 3
3 add the results from 1 and 2 together and divide by 10
4 take the remainder, if it is zero then use this value, otherwise subtract the
remainder from 10 to find the check digit.
Using the ISBN 9 7 8 0 3 4 0 9 8 3 8 2 (note this is the same ISBN as in Figure 2.15):
Odd digits

3 × (7 + 0 + 4 + 9 + 3 + 2) = 75

(36 + 75)/10 = 111/10 = 11 remainder 1
10 – 1 = 9 the check digit

shown in Figure 2.15):

Advice
You will not need
to remember the
steps shown in these
algorithms; the steps
will be given to you,
but it is important that
you understand how
to use an algorithm
to calculate or verify
check digits.

Calculation 2 – Re-calculation of the check digit from the thirteen-digit number
(which now includes the check digit)
To check that an ISBN 13-digit code is correct, including its check digit, a similar
process is followed:
1 add all the odd numbered digits together, including the check digit
2 add all the even number of digits together and multiply the result by 3
3 add the results from 1 and 2 together and divide by 10
4 the number is correct if the remainder is zero.
Using the ISBN 9 7 8 0 3 4 0 9 8 3 8 2 9 (including its check digit) from Figure 2.17:
1 9 + 8 + 3 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 45
2 3 × (7 + 0 + 4 + 9 + 3 + 2) = 75
3 (45 + 75)/10 = 120/10 = 12 remainder 0
4 remainder is 0, therefore number is correct.

Example 2: Modulo-11
The modulo-11 method can have varying lengths of number which makes it suitable
for many applications, such as product codes or VINs. The first calculation is the
generation of the check digit. The second calculation is a verification of the check digit
(that is, a recalculation).
Calculation 1 – Generation of the check digit from the other digits in a number
(In this example, we will assume the original number contained only 7 digits.)
The following algorithm generates the check digit from the other 7 digits:
1 each digit in the number is given a weighting of 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 starting from the
left (weightings start from 8 since the number will become eight-digit when the
check digit is added)
2 the digit is multiplied by its weighting and then each value is added to make a total
3 the total is divided by 11
4 the remainder is then subtracted from 11 to find the check digit (note if the
remainder is 10 then the check digit ‘X’ is used).
The example to be used has the following seven-digit number:
1 7-digit number: 4 1 5 6 7 1 0
weighting values: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
2 sum: (8 × 4) + (7 × 1) + (6 × 5) + (5 × 6) + (4 × 7) + (3 × 1) + (2 × 0)
= 32 + 7 + 30 + 30 + 28 + 3 + 0
total = 130
3 divide total by 11: 130/11 = 11 remainder 9
4 subtract remainder from 11: 11 – 9 = 2 (check digit)
So we end up with the following eight-digit: 4 1 5 6 7 1 0 2

Calculation 2 – Re-calculation of the check digit from the eight-digit number (which
now includes the check digit)
To check that the eight-digit number is correct, including its check digit, a similar
process is followed:
1 each digit in the number is given a weighting of 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 starting from
the left
2 the digit is multiplied by its weighting and then each value is added to make a total
3 the total is divided by 11
4 the number is correct if the remainder is zero

total = 132
3 divide total by 11: 132/11 = 12 remainder 0
4 remainder is 0, therefore number is correct

2.2.4 Automatic Repeat Requests (ARQs)
We have already considered parity checks and echo checks as methods to verify
that data has arrived at its destination unchanged. An Automatic Repeat
Request (ARQ) is a third way used to check data following data transmission.
This method can best be summarised as follows:
» ARQ uses positive and negative acknowledgements (messages sent to
the receiver indicating that data has/has not been received correctly)
and timeout (this is the time interval allowed to elapse before an
acknowledgement is received)
» the receiving device receives an error detection code as part of the data
transmission (this is typically a Cyclic Redundancy Check – refer to Section 2.1.1);
this is used to detect whether the received data contains any transmission errors
» if no error is detected, a positive acknowledgement is sent back to the
sending device
» however, if an error is detected, the receiving device now sends a negative
acknowledgement to the sending device and requests re-transmission of the data
» a time-out is used by the sending device by waiting a pre-determined amount
of time ….
» ... and if no acknowledgement of any type has been received by the sending
device within this time limit, it automatically re-sends the data until a
positive acknowledgement is received ….
» ... or until a pre-determined number of re-transmissions has taken place
» ARQ is often used by mobile phone networks to guarantee data integrity.

2.3 Symmetric and asymmetric encryption

2.3 Symmetric and asymmetric encryption
2.3.1 The purpose of encryption
When data is transmitted over any public network (wired or wireless), there
is always a risk of it being intercepted by, for example, a hacker. Under
these circumstances, a hacker is often referred to as an eavesdropper. Using
encryption helps to minimise this risk.
Encryption alters data into a form that is unreadable by anybody for whom the
data is not intended. It cannot prevent the data being intercepted, but it stops it
from making any sense to the eavesdropper. This is particularly important if the
data is sensitive or confidential (for example, credit card/bank details, medical
history or legal documents).

security see

Plaintext and ciphertext
The original data being sent is known as plaintext. Once it has gone through an
encryption algorithm, it produces ciphertext:

2.3.2 Symmetric and asymmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption uses an encryption key; the same key is used to encrypt
and decrypt the encoded message. First of all, consider a simple system that
uses a 10-digit denary encryption key (this gives 1 × 1010 possible codes); and a
decryption key. Suppose our encryption key is:
4291362856
which means every letter in a word is shifted across the alphabet +4, +2, +9, +1,
and so on, places. For example, here is the message COMPUTER SCIENCE IS
EXCITING (plaintext on the top line of Figure 2.19) before and after applying
the encryption key (forming the ciphertext shown on the bottom line of
Figure 2.19):

2 Data transmission

To get back to the original message, it will be necessary to apply the same
decryption key; that is, 4 2 9 1 3 6 2 8 5 6. But in this case, the decryption
process would be the reverse of encryption and each letter would be shifted –4,
–2, –9, –1, and so on. For example, ‘G’
‘C’, ‘Q’
‘O’, ‘V’
‘M’, ‘Q’
‘P’, and
so on.
However, modern computers could ‘crack’ this encryption key in a matter of
seconds. To try to combat this, we now use 256-bit binary encryption keys that
give 2256 (approximately, 1.2 × 1077) possible combinations. (Even this may not be
enough as we head towards quantum computers.)
Find out more
One of the ways of
mitigating the risk of
symmetric keys falling
into the wrong hands
(known as the key
distribution problem)
is to use a system
based on modulo-11,
where both sender and
receiver can calculate
the encryption key
without it actually
being exchanged in any
way. Find out how this
system works.

The real difficulty is keeping the encryption key a secret (for example, it needs
to be sent in an email or a text message which can be intercepted). Therefore,
the issue of security is always the main drawback of symmetrical encryption,
since a single encryption key is required for both sender and recipient.

Asymmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption was developed to overcome the security problems
associated with symmetric encryption. It makes use of two keys called the public
key and the private key:
» public key (made available to everybody)
» private key (only known to the computer user).
Both types of key are needed to encrypt and decrypt messages.
We will use an example to explain how this works; suppose Tom and Jane work for
the same company and Tom wishes to send a confidential document to Jane:
1 Jane uses an algorithm to generate a matching pair of keys (private and
public) that they must keep stored on their computers; the matching pairs of
keys are mathematically linked but can’t be derived from each other.
2 Jane now sends her public key to Tom.

4 Jane uses her matching private key ( ) to unlock Tom’s document and
decrypt it; this works because the public key used to encrypt the document
and the private key used to decrypt it are a matching pair generated on Jane’s
computer. (Jane can’t use the public key to decrypt the message.)

Activity 2.8
1 At the moment Jane can only receive encrypted documents from Tom.
Describe what would need to happen for Jane to be able to send encrypted
documents back to Tom.
2 Explain why this method is much more secure than symmetric encryption.

Jane can also exchange her public key with any number of people working in
the company, so she is able to receive encrypted messages (which have been
encrypted using her public key
) and she can then decrypt them using her
matching private key:

▲ Figure 2.22  The sharing of Jane’s public key

However, if a two-way communication is required between all five workers, then
they all need to generate their own matching public and private keys. Once this
is done, all users then need to swap public keys so that they can send encrypted
documents/files/messages between each other. Each worker will then use their
own private key to decrypt information being sent to them.

1 Using Figure 2.22 as your template, draw a new diagram showing the public
keys and private keys that need to be swapped if Jane wishes to have a two-way
exchange of encrypted documents between Tom, Susan, Mike and Megan.
2 Consider the complexity, if all five people want to have secure two-way
communication between each other (and not just with Jane). This would mean each
of the five workers sharing their own public keys with each of the other workers.

Extension
For those students considering the study of this subject at A Level, the following
section gives some insight into further study on encryption.
Quantum cryptography exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to improve
on the security of data. Quantum cryptography is based on the use of particles
of light called photons (with energy calculated according to the formula: E =
hf) and their physical quantum properties to produce a virtually unbreakable
encryption system. This helps protect the security of data being transmitted over
fibre optic cables. The technology is based on the laws of physics, rather than
mathematics which is how the current cryptography methods already covered in
this chapter work.
One of the uses of quantum cryptography is when sending encryption keys across
a network – this uses a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol (one of the most
common is called BB84).
QKD uses quantum mechanics to ensure a secure transmission of encryption
keys. They use a Qubit (Quantum bit) which is the basic unit of quantum ‘data’.
Unlike normal binary (which uses discrete 0s and 1s), the state of a Qubit is both 0
and 1 until the photon is measured.
A photon normally vibrates or oscillates in all different directions. Polarisation
restricts these vibrations to particular directions. The following diagram shows
how a photon can be polarised in one of two bases – the rectilinear (up/down and
side-to-side) basis and the diagonal basis. Do not worry too much about what
a basis is – you can just think of them as two different ways of preparing and
measuring the photon.

2 Data transmission

So how do we use quantum cryptography to send an encryption key from ‘A’ to ‘B’
using the QKD protocol? To understand this we need to note that:
» Photons can be polarised in one of two bases – rectilinear or diagonal.
» In the rectilinear basis, 1 can be represented by and 0 by . In the diagonal
basis 1 is and 0 is .
» A photon that is polarised in the rectilinear basis will always give the same
result when measured in the rectilinear basis. So, if a photon is polarised as ‘1’
in the rectilinear basis ( ) it will always be measured in the rectilinear basis to
have the polarisation .
» Similarly, a photon that is polarised in the diagonal basis will always give the
same result when measured in the diagonal basis. So, if a photon is polarised
as ‘1’ in the diagonal basis ( ) it will always be measured in the diagonal basis
to have the polarisation .
» However, if a photon is polarised in the rectilinear basis but measured in the
diagonal basis then information about the original polarisation is lost. The
result of the measurement has a 50-50 chance of being or because in
the diagonal basis the photon is in both 1 and 0 states at the same time! This
measurement tells the receiver nothing about the photon’s original polarisation
in the rectilinear basis.
» Similarly, if a photon is polarised in the diagonal basis but measured in the
rectilinear basis then information about the original polarisation is lost. The
result of the measurement has a 50-50 chance of being or because in
the rectilinear basis the photon is in both 1 and 0 states at the same time!
This tells the receiver nothing about the photon’s original polarisation in the
diagonal basis.
1 So, the sender polarises each photon using a basis that is selected at random.
2 The receiver measures each photon using a basis that is selected at random.
3 The sender and receiver publicly exchange which basis they used for each
photon.
Only when the sender and receiver use the same basis for measurement can they
be sure that are both reading a 1 or 0. When they used the same basis the receiver
knows they have measured a ‘1’ or ‘0’ correctly.

2.3 Symmetric and asymmetric encryption

Key terms used throughout this chapter
data packet – a small part of a message/data that is transmitted over a network; after
transmission all the data packets are reassembled to form the original message/data
packet header – the part of the data packet that contains the IP addresses of the sender
and receiver, and includes the packet number which allows reassembly of the data packets
packet trailer – the part of a data packet that indicates the end of the data packet and cyclic
redundancy check error check
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) – an error checking method in which all the 1-bits in
the data packet payload are added and the total is stored in the packet trailer; the same
calculation is repeated at the receiving station
payload – the actual data being carried in a data packet
node – stages in a network that can receive and transmit data packets; routers are nodes in
communication networks
packet switching – a method of transmission in which a message is broken into many data
packets which can then be sent along pathways independently of each other
router – a device that enables data packets to be moved between different networks, for
example to join a LAN to a WAN
real time streaming – the transmission of data over a network for live events where the
data is sent as soon as it is received or generated
hopping/hop number – a number in a data packet header used to stop data packets that
never reach their destination from ‘clogging up’ the data paths/routes
simplex – data that can be sent on one direction only
half-duplex – data that can be sent in both directions but not at the same time
full-duplex – data that can be sent in both directions at the same time (simultaneously)
serial data transmission – sending data down one channel/wire one bit at a time
parallel data transmission – sending data down several channels/wires several bits at a
time (usually 1 byte)
skewed (data) – data that arrives at the destination with the bits no longer synchronised
universal serial bus (USB) – a type of serial data transmission which has become the
industry standard for connecting computers to devices via a USB port
parity check – a method used to check if data has been transferred correctly; it makes use
of even parity (an even number of 1-bits) or odd parity (an odd number of 1-bits)
parity bit – a bit (either 0 or 1) added to a byte of data in the most significant bit position;
this ensures that the byte follows the correct even parity or odd parity protocol
parity block – a horizontal and vertical parity check on a block of data being transmitted
parity byte – an extra byte of data sent at the end of a parity block; it is composed of the
parity bits generated from a vertical parity check of the data block
checksum – a verification method used to check if data transferred has been altered or
corrupted; calculated from the block of data of data being sent; the checksum value is sent
after each data block

2 Data transmission

automatic repeat request (ARQ) – a method of checking transmitted data for errors; it
makes use of acknowledgement and timeout to automatically request re-sending of data if
the time interval before positive acknowledgement is too long
acknowledgement – a message sent to the receiver indicating that data has been received
correctly (used in the ARQ error detection method)
timeout – the time interval allowed to elapse before an acknowledgement is received (in
the ARQ error detection method)
echo check – a method used to check if data has been transferred correctly; data is sent
to a receiver and then immediately sent back to the sender; the sender then checks if the
received data matches the sent data
check digit – an additional digit appended to a number to check if the entered number is
error-free; check digit is a data entry check and not a data transmission check
eavesdropper – another name for a hacker who intercepts data being transmitted on a
wired or wireless network
encryption – the process of making data meaningless using encryption keys; without the
correct decryption key the data cannot be decoded (unscrambled)
plaintext – the original text/message before it is put through an encryption algorithm
ciphertext – encrypted data that is the result of putting a plaintext message through an
encryption algorithm
encryption algorithm – a complex piece of software that takes plaintext and generates an
encrypted string known as ciphertext
symmetric encryption – a type of encryption in which the same encryption key is used both
to encrypt and decrypt a message
asymmetric encryption – a type of encryption that uses public keys and private keys to
ensure data is secure
public key – a type of encryption key that is known to all users
private key – a type of encryption key which is known only to the single computer/user
quantum computer – a computer that can perform very fast calculations; it can perform
calculations that are based on probability rather than simple 0 or 1 values; this gives
a quantum computer the potential to process considerably more data than existing
computers
