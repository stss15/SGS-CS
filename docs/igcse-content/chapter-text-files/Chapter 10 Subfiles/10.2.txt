Note the use of Boolean algebra to
represent logic gates. This is optional at
IGCSE but many students may prefer to
use this notation (see NOTE later).

X = (A . B) + (A . B) (Boolean
algebra)

NOTE: this is sometimes written as:
(A + B) . (A . B)

Activity 10.1
Show why X = (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B)
and
Y = (A OR B) AND (NOT (A AND B)) both represent the same logic gate.

10 Boolean logic

You will notice in the Boolean algebra, three new symbols; these have the
following meaning:
» . represents the AND operation
» + represents the OR operation
» a bar (above the letter or letters, e.g. a) represents the NOT operation.
