Wired
There are three main types of cable used in wired
networks:
» twisted pair
» coaxial
» fibre optic.

3 Hardware

Wired versus wireless
When deciding whether a network should use wired or
wireless connectivity, the following factors should be
considered:
Wireless networking

Wired networking

it is easier to expand the networks and it isn’t necessary to
connect the devices using cables

using cables produces a more reliable and stable network;
wireless connectivity is often subject to interference

this gives devices increased mobility provided they are
within range of the WAPs

data transfer rates tend to be faster and there won’t be any
‘dead spots’

there is an increased chance of interference from external
sources

setting up cabled networks tends to be cheaper overall in
spite of the need to buy and install cable

data is less secure than with wired systems; it is easier to
intercept radio waves and microwaves than cables; it is
essential to protect data transmissions using encryption
(e.g. WEP, WPA2)

however, cabled networks lose the ability for devices to
be mobile; they must be close enough to allow for cable
connections

the data transmission rate is still slower than for cabled
networks although it continues to improve
it is possible for signals to be stopped by thick walls (e.g.
in old houses) and there may be areas of variable signal
strength leading to ‘drop out’

having lots of wires can lead to a number of hazards such
as tripping hazards, overheating of connections (leading
to potential fire risk) and disconnection of cables during
routine office cleaning

3.4 Network hardware

Key terms used throughout this chapter
central processing unit (CPU) – responsible for the
execution or processing of all the instructions and data in a
computer
integrated circuit – usually a chip made from a semiconductor material which carries out the same tasks as a
larger circuit made from individual components
von Neumann architecture – a type of computer
architecture which introduced the concept of the stored
program in the 1940s
Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU) – the component of the CPU
that carries out all arithmetic and logical operations
accumulator (ACC) – temporary general-purpose register
that stores numerical values at any part of a given
operation
memory address register (MAR) – a register that stores
the address of the memory location currently being read
from or written to
current instruction register (CIR) – a register that stores
the current instruction being decoded and executed
memory data register (MDR) – a register that stores data
that has just been read from memory or data that is about
to be written to memory
program counter (PC) – a register that stores the address
where the next instruction to be read can be found
control unit – the component of a computer’s CPU that
ensures synchronisation of data flow and programs
throughout the computer by sending out control signals
along the control bus
system clock – produces timing signals on the control bus
to ensure synchronisation takes place
clock cycle – clock speeds are measured in terms of GHz;
this is the vibrational frequency of the system clock which
sends out pulses along the control bus; for example, a
