Key terms used throughout this chapter
utility programs (utilities) – part of an operating system
which carries out certain functions such as virus checking,
defragmentation and screensaver
malware – programs (such as viruses, worms and
Trojan horses) that are installed on a user’s computer with
the aim of deleting, corrupting or manipulating
data illegally
anti-virus software – software that quarantines and
deletes files or programs infected by a computer virus;
the software can run in the background or be initiated
by the user
heuristic checking – checking software for behaviour that
could indicate a possible virus
quarantine – to isolate (in order to later delete) a file or
program identified by anti-virus software as being infected
by a virus
defragmentation – a process that reorganises sectors
on an HDD by rearranging blocks of data so that they are
contiguous
contiguous – next to each other
back-up – make copies of files onto another storage
media in case the original file becomes corrupted or is
deleted
screensaver – software that supplies a still or moving
image on a monitor if a computer has been inactive for a
period of time
device driver – software that communicates with the
operating system and translates data into a format
understood by the device
descriptor – a collection of information about a device
plugged into a USB port; this can be vendor ID (VID),
product ID (PID) or serial number
operating system – software that provides an environment
in which applications can run and also provides an interface
between computer and human operator

boot up/bootstrap loader – a small program that is used
to load other programs to correctly ‘start-up’ a computer
system
EEPROM – stands for electronically erasable
programmable ROM
human computer interface (HCI) – an interface supplied
by the operating system to ‘hide’ the complexities of the
software and hardware from the human user
command line interface (CLI) – an interface which allows
communication with the computer by typing in commands
using a keyboard
graphical user interface (GUI) – an interface that uses
icons to represent apps and tasks which the user can
select/launch by clicking on a mouse or using a touch
screen
windows icons menu and pointing device (WIMP) – an
interface that uses a pointing device such as  a mouse to
select options from screen icons or a menu
post-WIMP – a modern touch screen interface system that
allows actions such as pinching and rotating
memory management – the part of an operating system
that controls main memory
security management – the part of an operating system
that ensures the integrity, confidentiality and availability of
data
hardware management – the part of an operating system
that controls all input and output devices; it is made up of
sub-systems such as printer management
buffer – a memory area used to store data temporarily
file management – part of an operating system that
manages files in a computer (for example, the ability to
create, delete, copy, open, close and rename files)
interrupt – a signal sent from a device or software
to a microprocessor requesting its attention; the
microprocessor suspends all operations until the interrupt
has been serviced

4 Software

multitasking – a function that allows a computer to process
more than one task/process at a time
administrator – a person responsible for the upkeep and
maintenance of a computer system that involves
multi-user function
user account – an agreement that allows an individual to
use a computer; the user needs a user name and password
to enter the user’s area
error handling routine – a routine in a program or
operating system that recognises and recovers a system
from abnormal inputs or hardware faults (for example,
recovery from an attempt to divide by zero)

low-level language (LLL) – a programming language that
is dependent on computer hardware, both machine code
and assembly language are LLLs
assembly language – a programming language that is
dependent on computer hardware, a program written in an
assembly language program needs to be translated into
machine code before it is executed
assembler – a computer program that translates
programming code written in assembly language into
machine code
compiler – a computer program that translates a source
program written in a high-level language to machine code

firmware – a program that provides low level control for
devices

translator – converts a program written in a high-level
language program into machine code

interrupt priority – the priority assigned to an interrupt are
given a priority so that the microprocessor knows which
one needs to be serviced first and which interrupts are to
be dealt with quickly

interpreter – a computer program that analyses and
executes a program written in a high-level language line by
line

service (an interrupt) – when an interrupt is received,
some action needs to be taken by the processor depending
on what caused the interrupt; until this is resolved (that is,
it is serviced), the interrupt cannot be removed to allow the
processor to continue
interrupt service routine (ISR) – software that handles
interrupt requests (for example, when the printer out of
paper) and sends a request to the CPU for processing
machine code – a binary programming language, a
program written in machine code can be loaded and
executed without translation

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) – a suite of
programs used to write and test a computer program
written in a high-level language
debugging – finding errors in a computer program by
running or tracing the program
prettyprinting – displaying source code using different
colours and formatting, which make the code easier to read
and understand
report window – a separate window in the runtime
environment of an IDE that shows the contents of variables
during the execution of a program

high-level language (HLL) – a programming language that
is independent of computer hardware, a program written in
a HLL needs to be translated into machine code before it is
executed.
