1. Unit Description

This unit examines how students interact with the online world and how their behaviour shapes their digital identity. It explores the creation and impact of digital footprints, the importance of privacy, and the role of data in modern online platforms. Students examine real-world issues such as misinformation and cyberbullying, and they learn practical strategies to navigate online spaces safely and responsibly. The unit ends with a creative digital project in which students design a short artefact showing what a positive digital identity looks like.
