7. MINI TASK

———————————————————

Task Title: What Does the Platform Learn?
Instruction:
For each behaviour shown, write: “What data does the platform collect from this?”

Col 1 Content
	•	Watching a video
	•	Liking a post
	•	Commenting

Col 2 Content
	•	Scrolling past something
	•	Searching for something

Feedback (Correct Answers)

Feedback Col 1:
	•	Watching a video → watch time, completion rate, interests
	•	Liking a post → preferences, engagement level
	•	Commenting → tone, interests, interactions with others

Feedback Col 2:
	•	Scrolling past → what you ignore, what you avoid
	•	Searching for something → direct interests and intent

Key Misconception

“Algorithms only use what I post.”
In reality, they use behaviour — watch time, pauses, scrolling, and searches matter more than posts.
