	•	A genuine news website address
	•	Poor spelling or grammar
	•	Uses statistics without sources

	•	No links to evidence
	•	Website logo slightly altered

Likely Fake/Misleading:
	•	Sensational language
	•	No author

Key Misconception

“If lots of people share something, it must be true.”
Popularity ≠ accuracy. False information often spreads faster than factual information.
