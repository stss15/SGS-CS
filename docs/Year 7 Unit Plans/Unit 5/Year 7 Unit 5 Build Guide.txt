Unit 5: Digital Wellbeing & Smart Thinking

How Apps Hold Your Attention & How to Stay in Control

⸻

Unit Overview

This unit helps students understand how modern apps are designed to keep people watching, scrolling, or playing — and how to build healthy digital habits. Students look at real examples from the apps they use every day: notifications, endless scroll, autoplay, streaks, pop-ups, and recommended content. They learn simple thinking tools (spotting patterns, simplifying ideas, breaking routines into steps) to make sense of how these designs work.

The unit focuses on balance, attention, and wellbeing. It ends with students creating a short, clear “Digital Balance Guide” using easy, practical tips they can actually follow.
