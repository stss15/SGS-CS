Unit 1: Introduction to Computing

Digital Literacy, Organisation & Essential School Tools

⸻

Unit Overview

This unit gives students the foundation they need to work confidently and independently on their school devices. They learn how to navigate the MacBook, organise files properly, and use Office 365 tools as their main learning platform. By the end, students should know where their work lives, how to save it correctly, and how to access the resources teachers share in Teams and OneNote. The focus here is on building good habits early so every future unit runs smoothly.

Unit Objectives

By the end of the unit, students will be able to:
	•	Navigate the macOS interface confidently (Finder, Dock, Launchpad, file paths).
	•	Create and maintain an organised folder structure for schoolwork.
	•	Save, locate, and manage files using both local storage and OneDrive.
	•	Access and use Teams as the hub for communication, assignments, and resources.
	•	Navigate OneNote Class Notebook (Content Library vs. personal notebook) and create/edit pages.
	•	Understand the difference between local and cloud storage and when each is useful.
	•	Work collaboratively on shared OneNote pages in a safe and responsible way.

Concepts Covered

Although Unit 1 is primarily skills-based, it still supports the following St George’s Computer Science concepts:

Adaptation

What it means: How systems and users adjust to new tools and workflows.
How it appears in this unit: Students adapt to the school’s digital ecosystem — learning to move between apps, access cloud resources, and develop routines that support independent learning.

Form

What it means: How digital information is organised and structured.
How it appears in this unit: Students build consistent file structures and learn how systems like Teams/OneNote organise content.

Function

What it means: Understanding the purpose behind tools and systems.
How it appears in this unit: Students learn what Teams, OneNote, and cloud storage are for — and why the school uses them.

Skills Developed

Digital Literacy

Students learn core device skills that underpin all future computing work:
	•	Navigating macOS confidently (Finder, dock, system settings).
	•	Creating an organised, sustainable folder structure.
	•	Using Teams as a communication and assignment platform.
	•	Using OneNote Class Notebook for structured note-taking and digital work.
	•	Saving work responsibly (cloud vs local) and retrieving files reliably.

Data Handling (light touch in this unit)
	•	Understanding file types and file locations.
	•	Moving and organising files into meaningful structures.
	•	Knowing how cloud storage syncs and why organisation matters across devices.

Creativity in Technology (emerging)
	•	Customising their workspace (Dock, folders).
	•	Formatting and creating simple OneNote pages using text, images, and screenshots.
