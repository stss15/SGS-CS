Unit 3: Inside the Machine – Systems & Logic

Hardware, Networks & How Computers Make Decisions

⸻

Unit Overview

This unit takes students inside the computer to understand what actually makes it work. They learn the roles of key hardware components, how devices communicate through networks, and why machines follow strict rules instead of “thinking” like humans. The second half of the unit introduces Boolean logic — the true/false building blocks behind every decision a computer makes. Students explore logic using real-world examples, truth tables, and practical logic puzzles. By the end, they’ll understand what’s happening inside a computer system and how simple rules drive all digital decision-making.

Unit Objectives

Students will learn to:
	•	Identify core hardware components (CPU, RAM, Storage, Input/Output) and explain their functions.
	•	Distinguish clearly between hardware and software.
	•	Understand how networks work (LAN, WAN, the Internet) and how devices share information.
	•	Explain why computers rely on Boolean logic and describe AND, OR, and NOT.
	•	Build and interpret truth tables.
	•	Apply logic to real scenarios using practical activities and logic-based problem solving.
	•	Combine multiple conditions to design a simple “smart” response system on paper or through a practical activity.

Concepts Covered

Form

Meaning: Structure and organisation in systems.
In this unit: Students map the structure of a computer and identify how components form a functioning system.

Logic

Meaning: Rules that govern decisions and outcomes.
In this unit: Students use Boolean operations to reason through puzzles, scenarios, and rule-based systems.

Innovation

Meaning: Applying ideas to new or improved solutions.
In this unit: Students design a simple “smart system” using logical rules to solve a real problem.
