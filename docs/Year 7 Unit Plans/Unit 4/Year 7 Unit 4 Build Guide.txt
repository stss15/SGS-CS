Unit 4: Data & Representation

Binary, Number Systems & How Computers Store Information

⸻

Unit Overview

This unit introduces students to the idea that all digital information — numbers, text, images — is stored as patterns of 1s and 0s. Students learn why binary is used, how place value works in Base-2, and how to convert between binary and decimal. They apply this knowledge through guided practice, short challenges, and simple data-representation activities such as encoding small messages or analysing how characters are stored. By the end, students understand the link between number systems, logic, and how computers represent data.

Unit Objectives

Students will learn to:
	•	Explain why computers use binary to represent data.
	•	Convert between decimal (Base-10) and binary (Base-2) using place values.
	•	Understand the terms bit, byte, nibble, and file size units.
	•	Recognise how binary extends beyond numbers to represent characters (ASCII).
	•	Interpret and create small binary values (up to 8 bits).
	•	Apply binary skills in simple representation tasks, such as encoding or decoding short messages.
	•	Understand the role of binary as the foundation for all digital systems.

Concepts Covered

Data

Meaning: Raw values that can be stored and processed.
In this unit: Students see how numbers, letters, and simple symbols are reduced to binary patterns inside a computer.

Logic

Meaning: Rules that structure how data is represented and manipulated.
In this unit: Students use place-value logic to convert between number systems and reason about how binary structures information.

Skills Developed

Data Handling
	•	Converting between decimal and binary.
	•	Recognising data types represented in binary (numbers, characters).
	•	Working with place-value systems and fixed-bit representations.

Programming Foundations

(Theory-focused, no coding required.)
	•	Understanding how data is stored before it is processed.
	•	Connecting binary representation to how programs read and manipulate values.
	•	Applying systematic logic to translation tasks.
