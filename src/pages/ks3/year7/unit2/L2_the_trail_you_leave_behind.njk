    title: "Concept: Innovation"
    detail: "New technologies and features that change how we communicate, interact, and present ourselves online."
  skill:
    title: "Skill: Data Handling"
    detail: "Understanding how platforms collect, interpret, and use the data created through your online behaviour."
  objectives:
    - "Describe how platforms collect data based on interactions."
    - "Explain how recommendation systems influence what content you see."
    - "Identify examples of online features created through technological innovation."
  hook:
    title: "The Big Question"
    question: "“Why do two people using the same app see completely different content?”"
    detail: "Task: Write down two apps you use and what they show you first when you open them."
  miniTask:
    title: "What Does the Platform Learn?"
    prompt: "For each behaviour shown, write: “What data does the platform collect from this?”"
    items:
      - "Watching a video"
      - "Liking a post"
      - "Commenting"
      - "Scrolling past something"
      - "Searching for something"

    title: "Main Task"
    overview: "Placeholder: to be added after conceptual slides."
  plenary:
    title: "True or False?"
    prompt: "Answer these 3 questions in your book:"
    questions:
      - question: "“Platforms show everyone the same content.”"
        answer: "False"
        reason: "Feeds are personalised using behavioural data."
      - question: "“Recommendation systems know what I like because I tell them.”"
        answer: "False"
        reason: "They infer preferences from behaviour, not statements."
      - question: "“Algorithms mainly use likes to decide what to show me.”"
        answer: "False"
        reason: "Watch time and scrolling patterns are usually more important."

        <p>In reality, they use behaviour — watch time, pauses, scrolling, and searches matter more than posts.</p>
