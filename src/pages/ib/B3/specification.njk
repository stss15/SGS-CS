                <p>
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows us to model complex software
                    systems based on real-world objects. By encapsulating data and behavior into classes, we can create
                    modular, reusable, and scalable code. This topic explores the core principles of OOP, from basic
                    class design to advanced concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.
