                <p>
                    Programming is the tool we use to turn computational thinking into reality. In this topic, you will
                    master the fundamentals of coding, from variables and loops to complex data structures and
                    algorithms. You will learn how to write efficient, maintainable, and error-free code to solve
                    real-world problems.
