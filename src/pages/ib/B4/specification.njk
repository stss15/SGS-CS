                    Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are the building blocks of advanced software. They define how data is
                    stored, accessed, and manipulated without worrying about the underlying implementation details. In
                    this Higher Level topic, you will explore complex structures like linked lists, binary trees, and
                    hash tables, understanding when and why to use each one.
